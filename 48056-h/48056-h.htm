<p><span class="upper">Various</span> are the methods which
art and ingenuity have invented to
exhibit a picture of human life and
manners. These have differed from each
other, both in the mode of representation,
and in the particular view of the
subject which has been taken. With
respect to the first, it is universally allowed
that the dramatic form is by far
the most perfect. The circumstance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
leaving every character to display itself
in its own proper language, with all
the variations of tone and gesture which
distinguish it from others, and which
mark every emotion of the mind; and
the scenic delusions of dress, painting,
and machinery, contribute to stamp such
an appearance of reality upon dramatic
representations as no other of the imitative
arts can attain. Indeed, when
in their perfection, they can scarcely
be called imitations, but the very things
themselves; and real nature would perhaps
appear less perfect than her counterfeit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Drama has from early antiquity
been distinguished into the two grand
divisions of Tragedy and Comedy. It
would seem that the general character
of these was universally understood and
agreed on, by the adoption of the terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
<em>tragic</em> and <em>comic</em>, derived from them,
into the language of every civilized
people. The former of these is, we
know, constantly applied to objects of
terror and distress; the latter, to those
of mirth and pleasantry. There is, however,
a more comprehensive distinction
of our feelings, which it is proper first
to consider.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we examine the emotions produced
in our minds by the view of
human actions, we shall observe a division
into the <em>serious</em>, and the <em>ludicrous</em>.
I do not think it necessary to define or
analyse feelings with which all are well
acquainted. It is enough to observe that
serious emotions are produced by the
display of all the great passions which
agitate the soul, and by all those actions,
which are under the jurisdiction of the
grand rules of religion and morality;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and that ludicrous emotions are excited
by the improprieties and inconsistencies
of conduct or judgment in smaller matters;
such as the effects of false taste, or
trifling passions. When we now apply
the words <em>tragic</em> and <em>comic</em>, we shall at
once perceive that the former can relate
solely to such subjects as occasion <em>serious</em>,
and the latter to such as occasion <em>ludicrous</em>
emotions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Now,</span> although the practice of writers
has frequently introduced ludicrous parts
into the composition called a Tragedy,
and serious parts into that called a
Comedy, yet it has ever been understood
that what constitutes the essential and
invariable character of each is something
which is expressed by the terms <em>tragic</em>
and <em>comic</em>, and comes under the head of
<em>serious</em> or <em>ludicrous</em> emotions. Referring
therefore to a future consideration, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
propriety of introducing serious parts in
a Comedy, I shall now lay down the
character of Comedy as <em>a dramatic composition,
exhibiting a ludicrous picture of
human life and manners</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are two sources of ludicrous
emotions which it is proper here to distinguish.
One of these arises from <em>character</em>,
the other from <em>incident</em>. The first is attached
and appropriated to the person,
and makes a part, as it were, of his composition.
The other is merely accidental,
proceeding from awkward situations, odd
and uncommon circumstances, and the
like, which may happen indifferently to
every person. If we compare these with
regard to their dignity and utility, we
shall find a further difference; since that
proceeding from <em>character</em> belongs to a
very respectable part of knowledge, that
of human manners; and has for its end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the correction of foibles: whereas that
proceeding from <em>incident</em> is mean and
trivial in its origin, and answers no other
purpose than present mirth. ’Tis true, it
is perfectly natural to be pleased with
risible objects, even of the lowest kind,
and a fastidious aversion to their exhibition
may be accounted mere affected
nicety; yet, since we rank Comedy
among the higher and more refined species
of composition, let us assign it the
more honourable office of exhibiting and
correcting the ludicrous part of <em>characters</em>;
and leave to Bartholomew Fair
the ingenious contrivances of facetious
drollery, and handicraft merriment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following sources may be pointed
out from whence comic character is derived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nations,</span> like individuals, have certain
leading features which distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
them from others. Of these there are
always some of a ludicrous cast which
afford matter of entertainment to their
neighbours. Comedy has at all times
made very free with national peculiarities;
and, although the ridicule has often
been conducted in a trivial and illiberal
manner, by greatly overcharging the
picture, and introducing idle and unjust
accusations, yet I think we need not go
so far as entirely to reject this sort of
ludicrous painting; since it may be as
important to warn against the imitation
of foreign follies, as those of our own
growth. Indeed, when a Frenchman or
Irishman is brought upon our stage
merely to talk broken English, or make
bulls, there can be no plea either of wit
or utility to excuse the illiberal jest: but,
when the nicer distinctions of national
character are exposed with a just and delicate
ridicule, the spectacle may be both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
entertaining and instructive. Amidst the
tribe of foreign valets to be met with
on the English theatre, I would instance
<strong class="smcap">Canton</strong> in the <cite>Clandestine Marriage</cite>, as
an admirable example of true national
character, independent on language and
grimace. The obsequiousness and attentive
flattery of the servile Swiss-Frenchman
are quite characteristic, as well as
the careless insolence and affected airs of
<strong class="smcap">Brush</strong> the English footman<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. <strong class="smcap">O’Flaherty</strong>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the Irish soldier of fortune in
the <cite>West Indian</cite>, is an example of similar
merit; much more so, I think, than
the character from which the piece has
its title.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <div class="footnote">

  <p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
  <span class="smcap">I am</span> concerned to observe an instance of illiberal national
  ridicule without any merit of composition to palliate it, from a
  respectable dramatic writer, which is also rendered much more obnoxious
  by the circumstances. M. Voltaire’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ecossaise</cite> was purposely written
  to exhibit a worthy English character; marked, indeed, with some
  whimsical peculiarities, but distinguished by a strong spirit of
  benevolence. It was impossible to expose national foibles more gently
  than by combining them with national virtues. When this Piece was
  brought on our stage under the title of the <cite>English Merchant</cite>, a
  French valet was inserted among the <i>personæ dramatis</i>, characterised
  by nothing but his false English, and for no other end but to be
  exhibited as a scoundrel!</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> some part of the character
of a nation is pretty uniform and constant,
yet its manners and customs in
many points are extremely variable. These
variations are the peculiar modes and
fashions of the age; and hence the age, as
well as the nation, acquires a distinguishing
character. Fashion, in general, usurps
a dominion only over the smaller and less
important part of manners; such as dress,
public diversions, and other matters of
taste. The improprieties of fashion are
therefore of the absurd and ludicrous
kind, and consequently fit subjects of
comic ridicule. There is no source of Comedy
more fertile and pleasing than this;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and none in which the end of reformation
is likely to be so well answered. An extravagant
fashion is exhibited upon the
stage with such advantage of ridicule, that
it can scarcely stand long against it; and
I make no doubt that Moliere’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marquis
de Mascarille</cite>, and Cibber’s <cite>Lord Foppington</cite>,
had a considerable share in reforming
the prevailing foppery of the times. Fashion
has also too much interfered in some
more serious matters, as the sentiments
and studies of the age. Here too Comedy
has made its attacks; and the <cite>Alchemist</cite>,
the <cite>Virtuoso</cite>, the <cite>Antiquary</cite>, the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Belle
Esprit</cite>, have in their turns undergone the
ridicule of the stage, when their respective
pursuits, by being fashionable, were carried
to a fanciful extravagance. It is well
known that Moliere, in his comedies of
the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Femmes Sçavantes</cite>, and the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Precieuses
Ridicules</cite>, was as successful against the
pedantry and pretensions to wit which infected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the French nation, and particularly
the ladies, at that period, as Cervantes in
his attack upon knight-errantry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is another point of national or
fashionable folly in which Comedy might
be very useful; yet the attempt has been
found dangerous; and perhaps the subject
is too delicate for the stage, considering
the abuses to which it is liable. I mean
popular superstition, and priestcraft. Moliere,
who with impunity had attacked
every other species of folly, was almost
ruined by exposing a hypocrite and a devotee;
and the licentious ridicule of Dryden,
and others of that age, was generally
aimed, not only against superstition, but
religion. The <cite>Spanish Friar</cite>, however, is
an instance in which, with exquisite humour,
the ridicule can hardly be blamed
as improper; and it certainly did more
hurt to Roman Catholic superstition than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
he could ever remedy by his scholastic
<cite>Hind and Panther</cite>. How far the <cite>Minor</cite>
comes under the same description, would,
probably, be a subject of dispute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Particular</span> ranks and professions of
men have likewise characteristical peculiarities
which are capable of being placed
in a ludicrous view; and Comedy has
made frequent use of this source of ridicule.
In exposing professional, as well
as national absurdities, great illiberality
and unfairness have been shewn; both,
probably, from the same cause; a want
of sufficient acquaintance with the whole
characters, and taking a judgment of
them from a few external circumstances.
Yet, upon the whole, good effects may
have arisen even from this branch of Comedy;
since, by attacking a profession on
a side where it was really weak, the members
of it have been made sensible of,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and have reformed those circumstances
which rendered them ridiculous. A good-natured
physician can never be angry at
Moliere’s most laughable exhibitions of
the faculty, when he reflects that the follies
ridiculed, though exaggerated in the
representation, had a real existence; and,
by being held up to public derision, have
been in a great measure reformed. The
professors of law, being necessarily confined
to forms and rules, have not been
able to benefit so much from the comic
ridicule of which they have enjoyed an
equally plentiful share.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Besides</span> the arrangements which nation
and profession make of mankind,
there are certain natural classes formed
from the diversities of personal character.
Although the varieties of temper and disposition
in men are infinite, so that no two
persons probably ever existed in whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
there was an exact conformity, yet there
are certain leading features of character
which produce a general resemblance
among numerous individuals. Thus the
proud man, the vain, the sanguine, the
splenetic, the suspicious, the covetous, the
lavish, and so forth, are a sort of abstract
characters which divide the whole human
race amongst them. Now there are, belonging
to all these, objects of ridicule
which it has been the business of Comedy
to exhibit; and though, perhaps, no one
individual of each class perfectly resembled
the person held to view on the stage,
yet if all the circumstances exhibited are
contained in the general character, it appears
sufficiently natural. The <cite>Miser</cite> of
Moliere is not a picture of any one miser
who ever lived, but of a miser considered
as forming a class of human characters.
As these general classes, however, are few
in number, they must be soon exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
by the writers of Comedy, who have
been obliged, for the sake of variety, to
exhibit those peculiarities which are more
rare and singular. Hence have been
derived many pictures of that character
which we call an <em>humourist</em>; by which is
meant a character distinguished by certain
ludicrous singularities from the rest of
mankind. The humourist is not without
those marks of distinction which he may
acquire, like others, from rank, profession,
or temper of mind; but all
these are displayed in him after a manner
peculiarly his own, and dashed with his
leading oddities. A love of what is uncommon
and out of the way has often
occasioned such extravagance in the representation
of these characters as to
disgust from their want of probability;
but, where a due moderation is observed,
and the peculiarities, though unusual, are
such as really exist in nature, great entertainment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
may be derived from their exhibition.
Of this kind are the admirable
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Misanthrope</cite> and <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Malade Imaginaire</cite> of
Moliere; and the <cite>Old Bachelor</cite> and <cite>Sir
Sampson Legend</cite> of Congreve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> hence it appears but a small
gradation to the exhibition of individuals
upon the stage; and yet the difference is
important and essential. That which
marks out the distinction between individuals
of the same species is something
entirely uncommunicable; therefore the
rational end of Comedy, which is the reformation
of folly, cannot take place in
personal ridicule; for it will not be alledged
that reforming the person himself
is the object. Nor can it scarcely ever
be just to expose an individual to the ridicule
of the stage; since folly, and not
vice, being the proper subject of that ridicule,
it is hardly possible any one can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
deserve so severe a punishment. Indeed
the exposing of folly can scarcely be the
plea; for all the common, or even the
rarer kinds of folly lie open to the attack
of Comedy under fictitious characters, by
means of which the failing may be ridiculed
without the person. Personal ridicule
must therefore turn, as we find it
always has done, upon bodily imperfections,
awkward habits, and uncouth
gestures; which the low arts of mimickry
inhumanly drag forth to public view, for
the mean purpose of exciting present
merriment. In the best hands, personal
Comedy would be a degradation of the
stage, and an unwarrantable severity; but
in the hands it would be likely, if encouraged,
to fall into, it would prove an
intolerable nuisance. I should therefore,
without hesitation, join those who utterly
condemn this species of comic ridicule.
It is also to be considered, that the author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
shews his talents to disadvantage, and
cannot lay any basis of future fame, in
this walk. For the resemblance which
depends so much upon mimickry is lost
upon those of the audience who are not
acquainted with the original, and upon
every one who only reads the piece. Mr.
Foote’s works will aptly exemplify this
matter; in which the fund of genuine
Comedy, derived from happy strokes
upon the manners of the times, and uncommon,
but not entirely singular characters,
will secure a lasting admiration,
when the mimickry which supported the
parts of <em>Squintum</em> and <em>Cadwallader</em> is
despised or forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus attempted to trace the
different sources of what I conceive the
essential part of true Comedy, the <em>ridicule
derived from character</em>, it remains
to say somewhat of the mixture of additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
matter which it has received as a
composition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> a considerable period of modern
literature, <em>wit</em> was a commodity in
great request, and frequently to be met
with in all kinds of composition. It was
no where more abundant than in Comedy,
the genius of which it appeared
peculiarly to suit, from its gaiety and
satyrical smartness. Accordingly, the
language of Comedy was a string of repartees,
in which a thought was bandied
about from one to another, till it was
quite run out of breath. This made a
scene pass off with great vivacity; but
the misfortune was, that distinction of
character was quite lost in the contest.
Every personage, from the lord to the
valet, was as witty as the author himself;
and, provided good things enow were
said, it was no matter from whom they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
came. Congreve, with the greatest talents
for true comic humour, and the delineation
of ludicrous characters, was so over-run
with a fondness for brilliancy, as frequently
to break in upon consistency.
Wit is an admirable ornament of Comedy,
and, judiciously applied, is a high
relief to humour, but should never interfere
with the more essential parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are now, however, happily free
from all manner of danger of an inundation
of wit. No Congreve arises to disturb
the sententious gravity, and calm
simplicity of modern Comedy. A moralist
may congratulate the age on hearing from
the theatre compositions as pure, serious
and delicate, as are given from the pulpit.
When we consider how much wit and
humour, at the time they were most prevalent,
were perverted to vicious purposes,
we may rejoice at the sacrifice; yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
we may be allowed to feel a regret at the
loss of an amusement which might, certainly,
have been reconciled with innocence;
nay, might perhaps have pleaded
utility beyond what is substituted in its
room. <em>Sentimental Comedy</em>, as it is called,
contains but very faint discrimination of
character, and scarcely any thing of ridicule.
Its principal aim is to introduce
elegant and refined sentiment, particularly
of the benevolent cast; and to move the
heart by tender and interesting situations.
Hence they are, in general, much more
affecting than our modern Tragedies,
which are formed upon nearly the same
plan, but labour under the disadvantage
of a formal, stately stile, and manners
removed too far from the rank of common
life. One would not, perhaps, wish
altogether to banish from the stage pieces
so moral and innocent; yet it is a pity
they are not distinguished by some appropriated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
name from a thing they so little
resemble as true Comedy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I fear</span>, a view of modern manners in
other respects will scarcely allow us to
flatter ourselves that this change in the
theatre chiefly proceeds from improved
morality. It may, perhaps, be more justly
attributed to a false delicacy of taste,
which renders us unable to bear the representation
of low life; and to a real deficiency
in genius. With respect to the
first, genuine Comedy knows no distinction
of rank, but can as heartily enjoy a
humourous picture in the common walks
of life, where indeed the greatest variety
is to be found, as in the most cultivated
and refined. Some have placed the distinction
between Farce and Comedy in
the rank from whence the characters are
taken; but, I think, very improperly. If
there is any real distinction besides the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
length of the pieces, I should take it from
the different source of the humour; which
in Farce is mere ludicrous incident, but
in Comedy, ridiculous character. This
criterion, however, will not at all agree
with the titles under which each species
has already appeared.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> to the other cause, deficiency of
genius, it too plainly appears in many
other productions. Cold correctness has
laid her repressing hand upon imagination,
and damped all her powers. The
example of the ancients has been thought
to justify the gravity and simplicity of
modern Comedy. But, great as they were
in many qualities of the mind, in those of
wit and humour they were still more defective
than even ourselves in the present
age. They, who would eagerly catch at
a wretched pun, or a meager piece of
plot, were certainly with-held from witticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
and drollery by want of invention,
not justness of taste. I admire, in the
pure Latin of Terence, the elegant sentiment,
and still more the knowledge of
the human heart, with which he abounds;
but I would not on that account compare
his genius, at least in Comedy, with
Moliere and Congreve.</p>

<p class="no_indent">Moral sentiment is the cheapest product
of the mind. Novels, and magazines,
and even news-papers, are full of it;
but wit and humour threaten to leave us
with Chesterfield and Sterne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Still,</span> however, I would hope the
state of Comedy is not desperate. The
<cite>Clandestine Marriage</cite> exhibits an example
of comic merit, as various and perfect as
perhaps any piece in our language. All
the sources of ludicrous character have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
contributed to it. National ridicule appears
in Canton, and professional in Sterling.
Lord Ogleby is an excellent humourist.
Mrs. Heidleberg and her niece,
besides a comic pettishness of temper,
have plenty of fashionable follies, modified
by city vulgarism. Even the lovers
of tender sentiment have their share in
the entertainment; and I by no means
would object to its occasional introduction,
when, as it were, offering itself
from the circumstances. Then, besides
Mr. Foote’s comic theatre, we have several
pieces, which, though ranged under
the list of Farces, contain true and original
Comedy. Of these we may instance
the <cite>Citizen</cite>, <cite>Polly Honeycomb</cite>, <cite>the Upholsterer</cite>,
<cite>the Apprentice</cite>, and <cite>the Oxonian
in Town</cite>. It is a mistake to suppose that
the matter of Comedy can ever fail.
Though general characters may be exhausted,
yet the prevailing follies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
fashions of the times, with the singularities
starting up in particular ranks and
orders of men, must constantly supply
food for the ridicule of the stage. This
is lawful game; and the pursuit of it
is well worthy the encouragement of the
public, so long as it is unattended with
the licentiousness which disgraced the
wit of the last age. Let ridicule be sacred
to the interests of good sense and virtue;
let it never make a good character less
respectable, nor a bad one less obnoxious;
but let us not resign its use to common-place
maxim, and insipid sentiment.</p>

<p><span class="upper">In</span> that season of the year when the
serenity of the sky, the various fruits
which cover the ground, the discoloured
foliage of the trees, and all the sweet,
but fading graces of inspiring autumn,
open the mind to benevolence, and dispose
it for contemplation; I was wandering
in a beautiful and romantic country,
till curiosity began to give way to weariness;
and I sat me down on the fragment
of a rock overgrown with moss, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the rustling of the falling leaves, the
dashing of waters, and the hum of the
distant city, soothed my mind into the
most perfect tranquillity, and sleep insensibly
stole upon me, as I was indulging
the agreeable reveries which the objects
around me naturally inspired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I immediately</span> found myself in a vast
extended plain, in the middle of which
arose a mountain higher than I had before
any conception of. It was covered
with a multitude of people, chiefly youth;
many of whom pressed forwards with the
liveliest expression of ardour in their
countenance, though the way was in
many places steep and difficult. I observed,
that those who had but just begun
to climb the hill, thought themselves
not far from the top; but as they proceeded,
new hills were continually rising
to their view; and the summit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
highest they could before discern, seemed
but the foot of another, till the mountain
at length appeared to lose itself in
the clouds. As I was gazing on these
things with astonishment, my good Genius
suddenly appeared. ‘The mountain before
thee,’ said he, ‘is the <strong class="smcap">hill of
science</strong>. On the top is the temple of
Truth, whose head is above the clouds,
and whose face is covered with a veil of
pure light. Observe the progress of her
votaries; be silent, and attentive.’</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I saw</span> that the only regular approach
to the mountain was by a gate, called
the gate of languages. It was kept by a
woman of a pensive and thoughtful appearance,
whose lips were continually
moving, as though she repeated something
to herself. Her name was <strong class="smcap">memory</strong>.
On entering this first enclosure, I was
stunned with a confused murmur of jarring
voices, and dissonant sounds; which increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
upon me to such a degree, that
I was utterly confounded, and could compare
the noise to nothing but the confusion
of tongues at Babel. The road
was also rough and stony, and rendered
more difficult by heaps of rubbish, continually
tumbled down from the higher
parts of the mountain; and by broken
ruins of ancient buildings, which the travellers
were obliged to climb over at
every step; insomuch that many, disgusted
with so rough a beginning, turned
back, and attempted the mountain no
more: while others, having conquered
this difficulty, had no spirits to ascend
further, and sitting down on some fragment
of the rubbish, harangued the multitude
below with the greatest marks of
importance and self-complacency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> half way up the hill, I observed
on each side the path a thick forest
covered with continual fogs, and cut out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
into labyrinths, cross alleys, and serpentine
walks, entangled with thorns and
briars. This was called the <em>wood of error</em>:
and I heard the voices of many who were
lost up and down in it, calling to one
another, and endeavouring in vain to extricate
themselves. The trees in many
places shot their boughs over the path,
and a thick mist often rested on it; yet
never so much but that it was discernable
by the light which beamed from the
countenance of Truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the pleasantest part of the mountain
were placed the bowers of the Muses,
whose office it was to cheer the spirits of
the travellers, and encourage their fainting
steps with songs from their divine
harps. Not far from hence were the
<em>fields of fiction</em>, filled with a variety of
wild flowers springing up in the greatest
luxuriance, of richer scents and brighter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
colours than I had observed in any other
climate. And near them was the <em>dark
walk of allegory</em>, so artificially shaded,
that the light at noon-day was never
stronger than that of a bright moon-shine.
This gave it a pleasingly romantic
air for those who delighted in contemplation.
The paths and alleys were perplexed
with intricate windings, and were
all terminated with the statue of a Grace,
a Virtue, or a Muse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> I had observed these things, I
turned my eyes towards the multitudes
who were climbing the steep ascent, and
observed amongst them a youth of a lively
look, a piercing eye, and something fiery
and irregular in all his motions. His
name was <strong class="smcap">genius</strong>. He darted like an
eagle up the mountain, and left his companions
gazing after him with envy and
admiration: but his progress was unequal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and interrupted by a thousand caprices.
When Pleasure warbled in the valley, he
mingled in her train. When Pride beckoned
towards the precipice, he ventured
to the tottering edge. He delighted in
devious and untried paths; and made so
many excursions from the road, that his
feebler companions often outstripped him.
I observed that the Muses beheld him
with partiality; but Truth often frowned
and turned aside her face. While Genius
was thus wasting his strength in eccentric
flights, I saw a person of a very different
appearance, named <strong class="smcap">application</strong>. He
crept along with a slow and unremitting
pace, his eyes fixed on the top of the
mountain, patiently removing every stone
that obstructed his way, till he saw most of
those below him who had at first derided
his slow and toilsome progress. Indeed
there were few who ascended the hill with
equal and uninterrupted steadiness; for,
beside the difficulties of the way, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
were continually solicited to turn aside by
a numerous crowd of Appetites, Passions,
and Pleasures, whose importunity, when
they had once complied with, they became
less and less able to resist; and,
though they often returned to the path,
the asperities of the road were more severely
felt, the hill appeared more steep
and rugged, the fruits which were wholesome
and refreshing, seemed harsh and
ill-tasted, their sight grew dim, and their
feet tript at every little obstruction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I saw</span>, with some surprize, that the
Muses, whose business was to cheer and
encourage those who were toiling up the
ascent, would often sing in the bowers of
Pleasure, and accompany those who were
enticed away at the call of the Passions.
They accompanied them, however, but
a little way, and always forsook them
when they lost sight of the hill. Their
tyrants then doubled their chains upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the unhappy captives, and led them away
without resistance to the cells of Ignorance,
or the mansions of Misery.
Amongst the innumerable seducers, who
were endeavouring to draw away the
votaries of Truth from the path of
Science, there was one so little formidable
in her appearance, and so gentle and
languid in her attempts, that I should
scarcely have taken notice of her, but for
the numbers she had imperceptibly loaded
with her chains. <strong class="smcap">Indolence</strong> (for so she
was called), far from proceeding to open
hostilities, did not attempt to turn their
feet out of the path, but contented herself
with retarding their progress; and the
purpose she could not force them to
abandon, she persuaded them to delay.
Her touch had a power like that of the
Torpedo, which withered the strength of
those who came within its influence.
Her unhappy captives still turned their
faces towards the temple, and always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
hoped to arrive there; but the ground
seemed to slide from beneath their feet,
and they found themselves at the bottom
before they suspected that they had
changed their place. The placid serenity
which at first appeared in their countenance,
changed by degrees into a melancholy
languor, which was tinged with
deeper and deeper gloom as they glided
down the <em>stream of insignificance</em>; a dark
and sluggish water, which is curled by no
breeze, and enlivened by no murmur, till
it falls into a dead sea, where the startled
passengers are awakened by the shock,
and the next moment buried in the gulph
of oblivion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the unhappy deserters from the
paths of Science, none seemed less able to
return than the followers of Indolence.
The captives of Appetite and Passion
could often seize the moment when their
tyrants were languid or asleep to escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
from their enchantment; but the dominion
of Indolence was constant and
unremitted, and seldom resisted till resistance
was in vain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> contemplating these things, I
turned my eyes towards the top of the
mountain, where the air was always pure
and exhilarating, the path shaded with
laurels and other ever-greens, and the
effulgence which beamed from the face
of the Goddess seemed to shed a glory
round her votaries. Happy, said I,
are they who are permitted to ascend
the mountain!&mdash;but while I was pronouncing
this exclamation with uncommon
ardour, I saw standing beside me
a form of diviner features and a more
benign radiance. Happier, said she, are
those whom <strong class="smcap">virtue</strong> conducts to the
mansions of Content!&mdash;What, said I,
does Virtue then reside in the vale?&mdash;I
am found, said she, in the vale, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
I illuminate the mountain. I cheer the
cottager at his toil, and inspire the sage
at his meditation. I mingle in the crowd
of cities, and bless the hermit in his cell.
I have a temple in every heart that owns
my influence; and to him that wishes for
me I am already present. Science may
raise you to eminence, but I alone can
guide you to felicity! While the Goddess
was thus speaking, I stretched out my
arms towards her with a vehemence
which broke my slumbers. The chill
dews were falling around me, and the
shades of evening stretched over the landscape.
I hastened homeward, and resigned
the night to silence and meditation.</p>

<p><span class="upper">Of</span> all the multifarious productions
which the efforts of superior genius,
or the labours of scholastic industry,
have crowded upon the world, none are
perused with more insatiable avidity, or
disseminated with more universal applause,
than the narrations of feigned
events, descriptions of imaginary scenes,
and delineations of ideal characters. The
celebrity of other authors is confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
within very narrow limits. The Geometrician
and Divine, the Antiquary and
the Critic, however distinguished by uncontested
excellence, can only hope to
please those whom a conformity of disposition
has engaged in similar pursuits;
and must be content to be regarded by
the rest of the world with the smile of
frigid indifference, or the contemptuous
sneer of self-sufficient folly. The collector
of shells and the anatomist of insects
is little inclined to enter into theological
disputes: the Divine is not apt to
regard with veneration the uncouth
diagrams and tedious calculations of the
Astronomer: the man whose life has
been consumed in adjusting the disputes
of lexicographers, or elucidating the
learning of antiquity, cannot easily bend
his thoughts to recent transactions, or
readily interest himself in the unimportant
history of his contemporaries: and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Cit, who knows no business but acquiring
wealth, and no pleasure but displaying it,
has a heart equally shut up to argument
and fancy, to the batteries of syllogism,
and the arrows of wit. To the
writer of fiction alone, every ear is open,
and every tongue lavish of applause;
curiosity sparkles in every eye, and every
bosom is throbbing with concern.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is, however, easy to account for this
enchantment. To follow the chain of
perplexed ratiocination, to view with
critical skill the airy architecture of
systems, to unravel the web of sophistry,
or weigh the merits of opposite hypotheses,
requires perspicacity, and presupposes
learning. Works of this kind,
therefore, are not so well adapted to the
generality of readers as familiar and
colloquial composition; for few can reason,
but all can feel; and many who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
cannot enter into an argument, may yet
listen to a tale. The writer of Romance
has even an advantage over those who
endeavour to amuse by the play of fancy;
who, from the fortuitous collision of dissimilar
ideas produce the scintillations of
wit; or by the vivid glow of poetical
imagery delight the imagination with
colours of ideal radiance. The attraction
of the magnet is only exerted upon
similar particles; and to taste the beauties
of Homer, it is requisite to partake
his fire; but every one can relish the
author who represents common life, because
every one can refer to the originals
from whence his ideas were taken. He
relates events to which all are liable, and
applies to passions which all have felt.
The gloom of solitude, the languor of inaction,
the corrosions of disappointment,
and the toil of thought, induce men to
step aside from the rugged road of life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and wander in the fairy land of fiction;
where every bank is sprinkled with
flowers, and every gale loaded with perfume;
where every event introduces
a hero, and every cottage is inhabited by
a Grace. Invited by these flattering scenes,
the student quits the investigation of
truth, in which he perhaps meets with no
less fallacy, to exhilarate his mind with
new ideas, more agreeable, and more
easily attained: the busy relax their attention
by desultory reading, and smooth
the agitation of a ruffled mind with images
of peace, tranquillity, and pleasure: the
idle and the gay relieve the listlessness of
leisure, and diversify the round of life by
a rapid series of events pregnant with rapture
and astonishment; and the pensive
solitary fills up the vacuities of his heart
by interesting himself in the fortunes of
imaginary beings, and forming connections
with ideal excellence.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></p>

<p>It is, indeed, no ways extraordinary
that the mind should be charmed by fancy,
and attracted by pleasure; but that we
should listen with complacence to the
groans of misery, and delight to view the
exacerbations of complicated anguish, that
we should choose to chill the bosom with
imaginary fears, and dim the eyes with
fictitious sorrow, seems a kind of paradox
of the heart, and can only be credited
because it is universally felt. Various are
the hypotheses which have been formed
to account for the disposition of the
mind to riot in this species of intellectual
luxury. Some have imagined that we
are induced to acquiesce with greater patience
in our own lot, by beholding pictures
of life, tinged with deeper horrors,
and loaded with more excruciating calamities;
as, to a person suddenly emerging
out of a dark room, the faintest glimmering
of twilight assumes a lustre from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
contrasted gloom. Others, with yet
deeper refinement, suppose that we take
upon ourselves this burden of adscititious
sorrows, in order to feast upon the consciousness
of our own virtue. We commiserate
others, say they, that we may
applaud ourselves; and the sigh of compassionate
sympathy is always followed
by the gratulations of self-complacent
esteem. But surely they who would thus
reduce the sympathetic emotions of pity
to a system of refined selfishness, have
but ill attended to the genuine feelings
of humanity. It would, however, exceed
the limits of this paper, should I
attempt an accurate investigation of these
sentiments. But, let it be remembered,
that we are more attracted by those scenes
which interest our passions, or gratify our
curiosity, than those which delight our
fancy: and, so far from being indifferent
to the miseries of others, we are, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
time, totally regardless of our own. And
let not those on whom the hand of Time
has impressed the characters of oracular
wisdom, censure with too much acrimony
productions which are thus calculated
to please the imagination, and interest
the heart. They teach us to think,
by inuring us to feel: they ventilate the
mind by sudden gusts of passion; and
prevent the stagnation of thought, by a
fresh infusion of dissimilar ideas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> soft voice of sorrow is in
the breeze? what lovely sun-beam
of beauty trembling on the rock?
Its bright hair is bathed in showers; and
it looks faint and dim, through its mist
on the rushy plain. Why art thou alone,
maid of the mournful look? The cold
dropping rain is on the rocks of Torléna,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the blast of the desart lifts thy
yellow locks. Let thy steps be in the
hall of shells, by the blue winding stream
of Clutha: let the harp tremble beneath
thy fingers; and the sons of heroes listen
to the music of songs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shall</span> my steps be in the hall of shells,
and the aged low in the dust? The father
of Seláma is low behind this rock,
on his bed of wither’d leaves: the
thistle’s down is strewed over him by the
wind, and mixes with his grey hair. Thou
art fallen, chief of Etha! without thy
fame; and there is none to revenge thy
death. But thy daughter will sit, pale,
beside thee, till she sinks, a faded flower,
upon thy lifeless form. Leave the maid
of Clutha, son of the stranger! in the
red eye of her tears!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> fell the car-borne Connal, blue-eyed
mourner of the rock. Mine arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
is not weakened in battle; nor my sword
without its fame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Connal</span> was a fire in his youth, that
lighten’d through fields of renown: but
the flame weakly glimmered through grey
ashes of age. His course was like a star
moving through the heavens: it walketh
in brightness, but leaveth no track
behind; its silver path cannot be found
in the sky. The strength of Etha is rolled
away like a tale of other years; and
his eyes have failed. Feeble and dark,
he sits in his hall, and hears the distant
tread of a stranger’s steps; the haughty
steps of Tonthormo, from the roar of
Duvranno’s echoing stream. He stood in
the hall like a pillar of darkness, on whose
top is the red beam of fire: wide rolled his
eyes beneath the gloomy arch of his bent
brow; as flames in two caves of a rock,
over-hung with the black pine of the desart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
They had rolled on Seláma, and
he asked the daughter of Connal. Tonthormo!
breaker of shields! thou art a
meteor of death in war, whose fiery hair
streams on the clouds, and the nations
are withered beneath its path. Dwell,
Tonthormo! amidst thy hundred hills,
and listen to thy torrent’s roar; but the
soft sigh of the virgins is with the chief
of Crono; Hidallan is the dream of Seláma,
the dweller of her secret thoughts.
A rushing storm in war, a breeze that
sighs over the fallen foe; pleasant are
thy words of peace, and thy songs at the
mossy brook. Thy smiles are like the
moon-beams trembling on the waves.
Thy voice is the gale of summer that
whispers among the reeds of the lake,
and awakens the harp of Moilena with
all its lightly-trembling strings. Oh that
thy calm light was around me! my soul
should not fear the gloomy chief of Duvranno.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
He came with his stately steps.&mdash;My
shield is before thee, maid of my
love! a wall of shelter from the lightning
of swords. They fought. Tonthormo
bends in all his pride, before the arm
of youth. But a voice was in the breast
of Hidallan, shall I slay the love of Seláma?
Seláma dwells in thy dark bosom,
shall my steel enter there? Live,
thou storm of war! He gave again his
sword. But, careless as he strode away,
rage arose in the troubled thoughts of the
vanquish’d. He mark’d his time, and
sidelong pierced the heart of the generous
son of Semo. His fair hair is spread on
the dust, his eyes are bent on the trembling
beam of Clutha. Farewel, light
of my soul! They are closed in darkness.
Feeble wast thou then, my father!
and in vain didst thou call for help.
Thy grey locks are scatter’d, as a wreath
of snow on the top of a wither’d trunk;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
which the boy brushes away with his
staff; and careless singeth as he walks.
Who shall defend thee, my daughter!
said the broken voice of Etha’s chief.
Fair flower of the desart! the tempest
shall rush over thee; and thou shalt be
low beneath the foot of the savage son of
prey. But I will wither, my father, on
thy tomb. Weak and alone I dwell
amidst my tears, there is no young warrior
to lift the spear, no brother of love!
Oh that mine arm were strong! I would
rush amidst the battle. Seláma has no
friend!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Seláma has a friend, said the kindling
soul of Reuthamir. I will fight
thy battles, lovely daughter of kings;
and the sun of Duvranno shall set in
blood. But when I return in peace, and
the spirits of thy foes are on my sword,
meet me with thy smiles of love, maid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Clutha! with thy slow-rolling eyes. Let
the soft sound of thy steps be heard in
my halls, that the mother of Reuthamir
may rejoice. Whence, she will say, is
this beam of the distant land? Thou
shalt dwell in her bosom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> thoughts are with him who is low
in the dust, son of Cormac! But lift the
spear, thou friend of the unhappy! the
light of my soul may return.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> strode in his rattling arms. Tall,
in a gloomy forest, stood the surly
strength of Duvranno. Gleaming behind
the dark trees was his broad shield;
like the moon when it rises in blood,
and the dusky clouds sail low, and heavy,
athwart its path. Thoughts, like the
troubled ocean, rush’d over his soul,
and he struck, with his spear, the sounding
pine. Starting, he mix’d in battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
with the chief of woody Morna. Long
was the strife of arms; and the giant sons
of the forest trembled at their strokes.
At length Tonthormo fell&mdash;The sword
of Reuthamir wav’d, a blue flame, around
him. He bites the ground in rage.
His blood is poured, a dark red stream,
into Oithona’s trembling waves. Joy
brighten’d in the soul of Reuthamir;
when a young warrior came, with his
forward spear. He moved in the light
of beauty; but his words were haughty
and fierce. Is Tonthormo fallen in blood,
the friend of my early years? Die,
thou dark-soul’d chief! for never shall
Seláma be thine, the maid of his love.
Lovely shone her eyes, through tears, in
the hall of her grief, when I stood by the
chief of Duvranno, in the rising strife of
Clutha.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Retire,</span> thou swelling voice of pride!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
thy spear is light as the taper reed. Pierce
the roes of the desart; and call the hunter
to the feast of songs, but speak not of the
daughter of Connal, son of the feeble
arm! Seláma is the love of heroes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Try</span> thy strength with the feeble arm,
said the rising pride of youth. Thou
shalt vanish like a cloud of mist before
the sun, when he looks abroad in the
power of his brightness, and the storms
are rolled away from before his face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> thou thyself didst fall before Reuthamir,
in all thy boasting words. As a
tall ash of the mountain, when the tempest
takes its green head and lays it level
on the plain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Come</span> from thy secret cave, Seláma!
thy foes are silent and dark. Thou dove
that hidest in the clefts of the rocks! the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
storm is over and past. Come from thy
rock, Seláma! and give thy white hand
to the chief who never fled from the
face of glory, in all its terrible brightness.</p>

<p>She gave her hand, but it was trembling
and cold, for the spear was deep in
her side. Red, beneath her mail, the
current of crimson wandered down her
white breast, as the track of blood on
Cromla’s mountains of snow, when the
wounded deer slowly crosses the heath,
and the hunters cries are in the breeze.
Blest be the spear of Reuthamir! said the
faint voice of the lovely, I feel it cold
in my heart. Lay me by the son of Semo.
Why should I know another love?
Raise the tomb of the aged, his thin form
shall rejoice, as he sails on a low-hung
cloud, and guides the wintry storm. Open
your airy halls, spirits of my love!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> have I quench’d the light which
was pleasant to my soul? said the chief
of Morna. My steps moved in darkness,
why were the words of strife in thy
tale? Sorrow, like a cloud, comes over
my soul, and shades the joy of mighty
deeds. Soft be your rest in the narrow
house, children of grief! The breeze in
the long whistling grass shall not awaken
you. The tempest shall rush over you,
and the bulrush bow its head upon your
tomb, but silence shall dwell in your
habitation; long repose, and the peace of
years to come. The voice of the bard
shall raise your remembrance in the distant
land, and mingle your tale of woe
with the murmur of other streams. Often
shall the harp send forth a mournful
sound, and the tear dwell in the soft eyes
of the daughters of Morna.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> were the words of Reuthamir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
while he raised the tombs of the fallen.
Sad were his steps towards the towers of
his fathers, as musing he cross’d the
dark heath of Lena, and struck, at
times, the thistle’s beard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> most of the unhappiness in the
world arises rather from disappointed
desires, than from positive evil, it is
of the utmost consequence to attain just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
notions of the laws and order of the universe,
that we may not vex ourselves with
fruitless wishes, or give way to groundless
and unreasonable discontent. The laws
of natural philosophy, indeed, are tolerably
understood and attended to; and
though we may suffer inconveniences, we
are seldom disappointed in consequence of
them. No man expects to preserve orange-trees
in the open air through an English
winter; or when he has planted an acorn, to
see it become a large oak in a few months.
The mind of man naturally yields to necessity;
and our wishes soon subside when
we see the impossibility of their being
gratified. Now, upon an accurate inspection,
we shall find, in the moral government
of the world, and the order of
the intellectual system, laws as determinate
fixed and invariable as any in Newton’s
<cite class="plain">Principia</cite>. The progress of vegetation
is not more certain than the growth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of habit; nor is the power of attraction
more clearly proved than the force of affection
or the influence of example. The
man therefore who has well studied the
operations of nature in mind as well as
matter, will acquire a certain moderation
and equity in his claims upon Providence.
He never will be disappointed either in
himself or others. He will act with precision;
and expect that effect and that
alone from his efforts, which they are naturally
adapted to produce. For want
of this, men of merit and integrity often
censure the dispositions of Providence for
suffering characters they despise to run away
with advantages which, they yet
know, are purchased by such means as a
high and noble spirit could never submit
to. If you refuse to pay the price, why
expect the purchase? We should consider
this world as a great mart of commerce,
where fortune exposes to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
view various commodities, riches, ease,
tranquillity, fame, integrity, knowledge.
Every thing is marked at a settled price.
Our time, our labour, our ingenuity, is
so much ready money which we are to
lay out to the best advantage. Examine,
compare, choose, reject; but stand to
your own judgment; and do not, like
children, when you have purchased one
thing, repine that you do not possess another
which you did not purchase. Such
is the force of well-regulated industry,
that a steady and vigorous exertion of our
faculties, directed to one end, will generally
insure success. Would you, for instance,
be rich? Do you think that single
point worth the sacrificing every thing
else to? You may then be rich. Thousands
have become so from the lowest beginnings
by toil, and patient diligence,
and attention to the minutest articles of
expence and profit. But you must give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
up the pleasures of leisure, of a vacant
mind, of a free unsuspicious temper. If
you preserve your integrity, it must be a
coarse-spun and vulgar honesty. Those
high and lofty notions of morals which
you brought with you from the schools
must be considerably lowered, and mixed
with the baser alloy of a jealous and
worldly-minded prudence. You must
learn to do hard, if not unjust things;
and for the nice embarrassments of a delicate
and ingenuous spirit, it is necessary
for you to get rid of them as fast as possible.
You must shut your heart against
the Muses, and be content to feed your
understanding with plain, houshold truths.
In short, you must not attempt to enlarge
your ideas, or polish your taste, or refine
your sentiments; but must keep on in
one beaten track, without turning aside
either to the right hand or to the left.
“But I cannot submit to drudgery like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
this&mdash;I feel a spirit above it.” ’Tis well:
be above it then; only do not repine that
you are not rich.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Is</span> knowledge the pearl of peace?
That too may be purchased&mdash;by steady
application, and long solitary hours of
study and reflection. Bestow these, and
you shall be wise. “But (says the man
of letters) what a hardship is it that many
an illiterate fellow who cannot construe
the motto of the arms on his coach,
shall raise a fortune and make a figure,
while I have little more than the common
conveniences of life.” <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et tibi magna
satis!</i>&mdash;Was it in order to raise a fortune
that you consumed the sprightly hours of
youth in study and retirement? Was it
to be rich that you grew pale over the
midnight lamp, and distilled the sweetness
from the Greek and Roman spring? You
have then mistaken your path, and ill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
employed your industry. “What reward
have I then for all my labours?” What
reward! A large comprehensive soul,
well purged from vulgar fears, and perturbations,
and prejudices; able to comprehend
and interpret the works of man&mdash;of
God. A rich, flourishing, cultivated
mind, pregnant with inexhaustible
stores of entertainment and reflection. A
perpetual spring of fresh ideas; and the
conscious dignity of superior intelligence.
Good heaven! and what reward can you
ask besides?</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">But</span> is it not some reproach upon
the œconomy of Providence that such a
one, who is a mean dirty fellow, should
have amassed wealth enough to buy half
a nation?” Not in the least. He made
himself a mean dirty fellow for that very
end. He has paid his health, his conscience,
his liberty for it; and will you envy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
him his bargain? Will you hang
your head and blush in his presence because
he outshines you in equipage and
show? Lift up your brow with a noble
confidence, and say to yourself, I have
not these things, it is true; but it is because
I have not sought, because I have
not desired them; it is because I possess
something better. I have chosen my lot.
I am content and satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> are a modest man&mdash;You love
quiet and independence, and have a delicacy
and reserve in your temper which
renders it impossible for you to elbow
your way in the world, and be the herald
of your own merits. Be content then
with a modest retirement, with the esteem
of your intimate friends, with the praises
of a blameless heart, and a delicate ingenuous
spirit; but resign the splendid distinctions
of the world to those who can
better scramble for them.</p>

<p>The man whose tender sensibility of
conscience and strict regard to the rules

fearful of offending, is often heard to complain

in every path of honour and profit.
“Could I but get over some nice points,
and conform to the practice and opinion
of those about me, I might stand as fair
a chance as others for dignities and preferment.”
And why can you not?
What hinders you from discarding this
troublesome scrupulosity of yours which
stands so grievously in your way? If it
be a small thing to enjoy a healthful
mind, found at the very core, that does
not shrink from the keenest inspection;
inward freedom from remorse and perturbation;
unsullied whiteness and simplicity
of manners; a genuine integrity</p>

considering that their talents are commonly

not obliged to reward any one who is not
useful to it. The Poets have been a very
unreasonable race, and have often complained
loudly of the neglect of genius
and the ingratitude of the age. The tender
and pensive Cowley, and the elegant
Shenstone, had their minds tinctured by
this discontent; and even the sublime
melancholy of Young was too much owing
to the stings of disappointed ambition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> moderation we have been endeavouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
to inculcate will likewise prevent
much mortification and disgust in our
commerce with mankind. As we ought
not to wish in ourselves, so neither should
we expect in our friends contrary qualifications.
Young and sanguine, when we
enter the world, and feel our affections
drawn forth by any particular excellence
in a character, we immediately give it
credit for all others; and are beyond measure
disgusted when we come to discover,
as we soon must discover, the defects in
the other side of the balance. But nature
is much more frugal than to heap together
all manner of shining qualities in one
glaring mass. Like a judicious painter
she endeavours to preserve a certain unity
of stile and colouring in her pieces. Models
of absolute perfection are only to be
met with in romance; where exquisite
beauty and brilliant wit, and profound
judgment, and immaculate virtue, are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
blended together to adorn some favourite
character. As an anatomist knows that
the racer cannot have the strength and
muscles of the draught-horse; and that
winged men, gryffons, and mermaids must
be mere creatures of the imagination; so
the philosopher is sensible that there are
combinations of moral qualities which
never can take place but in idea. There
is a different air and complexion in characters
as well as in faces, though perhaps
each equally beautiful; and the excellencies
of one cannot be transferred to
the other. Thus if one man possesses a
stoical apathy of soul, acts independent
of the opinion of the world, and fulfils
every duty with mathematical exactness,
you must not expect that man to be
greatly influenced by the weakness of
pity, or the partialities of friendship:
you must not be offended that he does
not fly to meet you after a short absence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
or require from him the convivial spirit
and honest effusions of a warm, open,
susceptible heart. If another is remarkable
for a lively active zeal, inflexible integrity,
a strong indignation against vice,
and freedom in reproving it, he will probably
have some little bluntness in his
address not altogether suitable to polished
life; he will want the winning arts of
conversation; he will disgust by a kind
of haughtiness and negligence in his
manner, and often hurt the delicacy of
his acquaintance with harsh and disagreeable
truths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> usually say&mdash;that man is a genius,
<em>but</em> he has some whims and oddities&mdash;such
a one has a very general knowledge,
<em>but</em> he is superficial; <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Now in all
such cases we should speak more rationally
did we substitute <em>therefore</em> for <em>but</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
He is a genius, <em>therefore</em> he is whimsical;
and the like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the fault of the present age, owing
to the freer commerce that different
ranks and professions now enjoy with
each other, that characters are not marked
with sufficient strength: the several
classes run too much into one another.
We have fewer pedants, it is true, but
we have fewer striking originals. Every
one is expected to have such a tincture
of general knowledge as is incompatible
with going deep into any science; and
such a conformity to fashionable manners
as checks the free workings of the ruling
passion, and gives an insipid sameness to
the face of society, under the idea of polish
and regularity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a cast of manners peculiar
and becoming to each age, sex, and profession;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
one, therefore, should not throw
out illiberal and common-place censures
against another. Each is perfect in its
kind. A woman as a woman: a tradesman
as a tradesman. We are often
hurt by the brutality and sluggish conceptions
of the vulgar; not considering
that some there must be to be hewers of
wood and drawers of water, and that
cultivated genius, or even any great refinement
and delicacy in their moral
feelings, would be a real misfortune to
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us then study the philosophy of
the human mind. The man who is
master of this science, will know what to
expect from every one. From this man,
wise advice; from that, cordial sympathy;
from another, casual entertainment.
The passions and inclinations of
others are his tools, which he can use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
with as much precision as he would the
mechanical powers; and he can as readily
make allowance for the workings of
vanity, or the bias of self-interest in his
friends, as for the power of friction, or
the irregularities of the needle.</p>

CANAL <span class="minor_words">AND THE</span> BROOK.<br />

<span class="head_smaller"><span class="spread_mini"><span class="smcap">An</span> APOLOGU</span>E.</span></h2>

<p><span class="upper">A delightfully</span> pleasant evening
succeeding a sultry summer-day, invited
me to take a solitary walk; and
leaving the dust of the highway, I fell
into a path which led along a pleasant
little valley watered by a small meandering
brook. The meadow-ground on its banks
had been lately mown, and the new grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
was springing up with a lively verdure.
The brook was hid in several places by
shrubs that grew on each side, and intermingled
their branches. The sides of
the valley were roughened by small irregular
thickets; and the whole scene had
an air of solitude and retirement, uncommon
in the neighbourhood of a populous
town. The Duke of Bridgewater’s canal
crossed the valley, high raised on a mound
of earth, which preserved a level with the
elevated ground on each side. An arched
road was carried under it, beneath which
the brook that ran along the valley was
conveyed by a subterraneous passage. I
threw myself upon a green bank, shaded
by a leafy thicket, and resting my head
upon my hand, after a welcome indolence
had overcome my senses, I saw, with the
eyes of fancy, the following scene.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> firm-built side of the aqueduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
suddenly opened, and a gigantic form
issued forth, which I soon discovered to
be the <em>Genius of the Canal</em>. He was clad
in a close garment of a russet hue. A
mural crown, indented with battlements,
surrounded his brow. His naked feet
were discoloured with clay. On his left
shoulder he bore a huge pick-ax; and in
his right hand he held certain instruments,
used in surveying and levelling. His
looks were thoughtful, and his features
harsh. The breach through which he
proceeded, instantly closed; and with a
heavy tread he advanced into the valley.
As he approached the brook, the <em>Deity of
the Stream</em> arose to meet him. He was
habited in a light green mantle, and the
clear drops fell from his dark hair, which
was encircled with a wreath of water lily,
interwoven with sweet scented flag. An
angling rod supported his steps. The
Genius of the Canal eyed him with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
contemptuous look, and in a hoarse voice
thus began:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hence,</span> ignoble rill! with thy scanty
tribute to thy lord, the Mersey; nor
thus waste thy almost exhausted urn in
lingering windings along the vale.
Feeble as thine aid is, it will not be
unacceptable to that master stream
himself; for, as I lately crossed his
channel, I perceived his sands loaded
with stranded vessels. I saw, and pitied
him, for undertaking a task to which
he is unequal. But thou, whose languid
current is obscured by weeds, and interrupted
by mishapen pebbles; who
losest thyself in endless mazes, remote
from any sound, but thy own idle
gurgling; how canst thou support an
existence so contemptible and useless?
For me, the noblest child of art, who
hold my unremitting course from hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
to hill, over vales and rivers; who
pierce the solid rock for my passage,
and connect unknown lands with
distant seas; wherever I appear I am
viewed with astonishment, and exulting
commerce hails my waves. Behold
my channel thronged with capacious
vessels for the conveyance of merchandise,
and splendid barges for the
use and pleasure of travellers; my
banks crowned with airy bridges and
huge warehouses, and echoing with
the busy sounds of industry. Pay then
the homage due from sloth and obscurity
to grandeur and utility.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I readily</span> acknowledge,” replied
the Deity of the Brook, in a modest accent,
“the superior magnificence and
more extensive utility of which you so
proudly boast; yet, in my humble walk,
I am not void of a praise, less shining,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
but not less solid than yours. The
nymph of this peaceful valley, rendered
more fertile and beautiful by my
stream; the neighbouring sylvan deities,
to whose pleasure I contribute, will
pay a grateful testimony to my merit.
The windings of my course, which you
so much blame, serve to diffuse over a
greater extent of ground the refreshment
of my waters; and the lovers of
nature and the Muses, who are fond of
straying on my banks, are better pleased
that the line of beauty marks my way,
than if, like yours, it were directed in a
straight, unvaried line. They prize the
irregular wildness with which I am
decked, as the charms of beauteous simplicity.
What you call the weeds which
darken and obscure my waves, afford
to the botanist a pleasing speculation of
the works of nature; and the poet and
painter think the lustre of my stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
greatly improved by glittering through
them. The pebbles which diversify
my bottom, and make these ripplings
in my current, are pleasing objects to
the eye of taste; and my simple murmurs
are more melodious to the learned
ear, than all the rude noises of your
banks, or even the music that resounds
from your stately barges. If the unfeeling
sons of wealth and commerce
judge of me by the mere standard of
usefulness, I may claim no undistinguished
rank. While your waters, confined
in deep channels, or lifted above
the valleys, roll on, a useless burden to
the fields, and only subservient to the
drudgery of bearing temporary merchandises,
my stream will bestow unvarying
fertility on the meadows, during
the summers of future ages. Yet
I scorn to submit my honours to the
decision of those, whose hearts are shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
up to taste and sentiment. Let me appeal
to nobler judges. The philosopher
and poet, by whose labours the human
mind is elevated and refined, and
opened to pleasures beyond the conception
of vulgar souls, will acknowledge
that the elegant deities who preside
over simple and natural beauty,
have inspired them with their charming
and instructive ideas. The sweetest
and most majestic bard that ever sung,
has taken a pride in owning his affection
to woods and streams; and
while the stupendous monuments of
Roman grandeur, the columns which
pierced the skies, and the aqueducts
which poured their waves over mountains
and valleys, are sunk in oblivion,
the gently winding Mincius still retains
his tranquil honours. And when
thy glories, proud Genius! are lost and
forgotten; when the flood of commerce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
which now supplies thy urn, is
turned into another course, and has
left thy channel dry and desolate; the
softly-flowing Avon shall still murmur
in song, and his banks receive the
homage of all who are beloved by
Phœbus and the Muses.”</p>

<h2 class="chapter" title="On Monastic Institutions"><span class="minor_words">ON</span><br />

<span class="head_smaller word_sep">MONASTIC INSTITUTIONS.</span></h2>

<p><span class="titlecap">I happened</span> the other day to take
a solitary walk amongst the venerable
ruins of an old Abbey. The stillness and
solemnity of the place were favourable
to thought, and naturally led me to a
train of ideas relative to the scene; when,
like a good protestant, I began to indulge
a secret triumph in the ruin of so
many structures which I had always considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
as the haunts of ignorance and
superstition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ye</span> are fallen, said I, ye dark and
gloomy mansions of mistaken zeal, where
the proud priest and lazy monk fattened
upon the riches of the land, and crept
like vermin from their cells to spread
their poisonous doctrines through the
nation, and disturb the peace of kings.
Obscure in their origin, but daring and
ambitious in their guilt! See how the
pure light of heaven is clouded by the
dim glass of the arched window, stained
with the gaudy colours of monkish
tales and legendary fiction; fit emblem
how reluctantly they admitted the fairer
light of truth amidst these dark recesses,
and how much they have debased its
genuine lustre! The low cells, the long
and narrow aisles, the gloomy arches, the
damp and secret caverns which wind beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the hollow ground, far from impressing
on the mind the idea of the God
of truth and love, seem only fit for those
dark places of the earth in which are
the habitations of cruelty. These massy
stones and scattered reliques of the vast
edifice, like the large bones and gigantic
armour of a once formidable ruffian,
produce emotions of mingled dread and
exultation. Farewel, ye once venerated
seats! enough of you remains, and may
it always remain, to remind us from what
we have escaped, and make posterity for
ever thankful for this fairer age of liberty
and light.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> were for a while my meditations;
but it is cruel to insult a fallen enemy,
and I gradually fell into a different train
of thought. I began to consider whether
something might not be advanced in favour
of these institutions during the barbarous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
ages in which they flourished; and
though they have been productive of
much mischief and superstition, whether
they might not have spread the glimmering
of a feeble ray of knowledge, through
that thick night which once involved the
western hemisphere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> where, indeed, could the precious
remains of classical learning, and the divine
monuments of ancient taste, have
been safely lodged amidst the ravages of
that age of ferocity and rapine which succeeded
the desolation of the Roman empire,
except in sanctuaries like these, consecrated
by the superstition of the times
beyond their intrinsic merit? The frequency
of wars, and the licentious cruelty
with which they were conducted, left
neither the hamlet of the peasant nor the
castle of the baron free from depredation;
but the church and monastery generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
remained inviolate. There Homer and
Aristotle were obliged to shroud their
heads from the rage of gothic ignorance;
and there the sacred records of divine
truth were preserved, like treasure hid in
the earth in troublesome times, safe, but
unenjoyed. Some of the barbarous nations
were converted before their conquests,
and most of them soon after their
settlement in the countries they over-ran.
Those buildings which their new faith
taught them to venerate, afforded a shelter
for those valuable manuscripts, which
must otherwise have been destroyed in the
common wreck. At the revival of learning,
they were produced from their dormitories.
A copy of the pandect of Justinian,
that valuable remain of Roman
law, which first gave to Europe the idea
of a more perfect jurisprudence, and gave
men a relish for a new and important
study, was discovered in a monastery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Amalphi. Most of the classics were recovered
by the same means; and to this
it is owing, to the books and learning
preserved in these repositories, that we
were not obliged to begin anew, and trace
every art by slow and uncertain steps
from its first origin. Science, already full
grown and vigorous, awaked as from a
trance, shook her pinions, and soon soared
to the heights of knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nor</span> was she entirely idle during her
recess; at least we cannot but confess
that what little learning remained in the
world was amongst the priests and religious
orders. Books, before the invention
of paper, and the art of printing,
were so dear, that few private persons
possessed any. The only libraries were
in convents; and the monks were often
employed in transcribing manuscripts,
which was a very tedious, and at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
time a very necessary task. It was frequently
enjoined as a penance for some
slight offence, or given as an exercise to
the younger part of the community. The
monks were obliged by their rules to
spend some stated hours every day in
reading and study; nor was any one to be
chosen abbot without a competent share
of learning. They were the only historians;
and though their accounts be interwoven
with many a legendary tale, and
darkened by much superstition, still they
are better than no histories at all; and
we cannot but think ourselves obliged
to them for transmitting to us, in any
dress, the annals of their country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were likewise almost the sole
instructors of youth. Towards the end of
the tenth century, there were no schools
in Europe but the monasteries, and those
which belonged to episcopal residences;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
nor any masters but the Benedictines. It
is true, their course of education extended
no further than what they called the seven
liberal arts, and these were taught in a
very dry and uninteresting manner. But
this was the genius of the age, and it
should not be imputed to them as a reproach
that they did not teach well, when
no one taught better. We are guilty of
great unfairness when we compare the
school-men with the philosophers of a
more enlightened age: we should contrast
them with those of their own times; with
a high-constable of France who could not
read; with kings who made the sign of
the cross in confirmation of their charters,
because they could not write their names;
with a whole people without the least
glimmering of taste or literature. Whatever
was their real knowledge, there was
a much greater difference between men of
learning, and the bulk of the nation, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
that time, than there is at present; and
certainly, some of the disciples of those
schools who, though now fallen into disrepute,
were revered in their day by
the names of the subtle, or the angelic
doctors, shewed an acuteness and strength
of genius, which, if properly directed,
would have gone far in philosophy; and
they only failed because their enquiries
were not the objects of the human powers.
Had they exercised half that acuteness on
facts and experiments, they had been
truly great men. However, there were not
wanting some, even in the darkest ages,
whose names will be always remembered
with pleasure by the lovers of science.
Alcuin, the preceptor of Charlemagne,
the first who introduced a taste for polite
literature into France, and the chief instrument
that prince made use of in his
noble endeavours for the encouragement
of learning; to whom the universities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Soissons, Tours and Paris owe their origin:
the historians, Mathew Paris,
William of Malmsbury; Savanarola; the
elegant and unfortunate Abelard; and, to
crown the rest, the English Franciscan,
Roger Bacon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may be here observed, that forbidding
the vulgar tongue in the offices of
devotion, and in reading the scriptures,
though undoubtedly a great corruption
in the Christian Church, was of infinite
service to the interests of learning. When
the ecclesiastics had locked up their religion
in a foreign tongue, they would take
care not to lose the key. This gave an
importance to the learned languages; and
every scholar could not only read, but
wrote and disputed in Latin, which without
such a motive would probably have
been no more studied than the Chinese.
And at a time when the modern languages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of Europe were yet unformed and
barbarous, Latin was of great use as a
kind of universal tongue, by which learned
men might converse and correspond
with each other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indeed</span> the monks were almost the
only set of men who had leisure or opportunity
to pay the least attention to literary
subjects. A learned education (and a
very little went to that title) was reckoned
peculiar to the religious. It was almost
esteemed a blemish on the savage
and martial character of the gentry, to
have any tincture of letters. A man,
therefore, of a studious and retired turn,
averse to quarrels, and not desirous of
the fierce and sanguinary glory of those
times, beheld in the cloister a peaceful
and honourable sanctuary; where, without
the reproach of cowardice, or danger
of invasion, he might devote himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
learning, associate with men of his own
turn, and have free access to libraries and
manuscripts. In this enlightened and polished
age, where learning is diffused
through every rank, and many a merchant’s
clerk possesses more real knowledge
than half the literati of that æra,
we can scarcely conceive how gross an
ignorance overspread those times, and
how totally all useful learning might have
been lost amongst us, had it not been for
an order of men, veiled with peculiar privileges,
and protected by even a superstitious
degree of reverence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> the Muses, with their attendant
arts, in strange disguise indeed, and uncouth
trappings, took refuge in the peaceful
gloom of the convent. Statuary carved
a madonna or a crucifix; Painting
illuminated a missal; Eloquence made
the panegyric of a saint; and History composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
a legend. Yet still they breathed,
and were ready, at any happier period, to
emerge from obscurity with all their native
charms and undiminished lustre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> there were other views in which
those who devoted themselves to a monastic
life might be supposed useful to society.
They were often employed either
in cultivating their gardens, or in curious
mechanical works; as indeed the nuns
are still famous for many elegant and ingenious
manufactures. By the constant
communication they had with those of
their own order, and with their common
head at Rome, they maintained some intercourse
between nations at a time when
travelling was dangerous, and commerce
had not, as now, made the most distant
parts of the globe familiar to each other:
and they kept up a more intimate bond
of union amongst learned men of all countries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
who would otherwise have been secluded
from all knowledge of each other.
A monk might travel with more convenience
than any one else; his person was
safer, and he was sure of meeting with
proper accommodations. The intercourse
with Rome must have been peculiarly
favourable to these northern nations; as
Italy for a long time led the way in every
improvement of politeness or literature:
and if we imported their superstition, we
likewise imported their manufactures, their
knowledge, and their taste. Thus Alfred
sent for Italian monks, when he wanted to
civilize his people, and introduce amongst
them some tincture of letters. It may
likewise be presumed that they tempered
the rigour of monarchy. Indeed they, as
well as the sovereigns, endeavoured to enslave
the people; but subjection was not
likely to be so abject and unlimited
where the object of it was divided, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
each showed by turns that the other might
be opposed. It must have been of service
to the cause of liberty to have a set of men,
whose laws, privileges, and immunities
the most daring kings were afraid to
trample on; and this, before a more enlightened
spirit of freedom had arisen,
might have its effect in preventing the
states of christendom from falling into
such entire slavery as the Asiatics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> an order would in some degree
check the excessive regard paid to birth.
A man of mean origin and obscure parentage
saw himself excluded from almost
every path of secular preferment, and almost
treated as a being of an inferior species
by the high and haughty spirit of
the gentry; but he was at liberty to aspire
to the highest dignities of the church;
and there have been many who, like Sextus
<abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> and cardinal Wolsey, have by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
industry and personal merit alone raised
themselves to a level with kings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> should likewise be remembered that
many of the orders were charitable institutions;
as the <em>knights of faith and charity</em>
in the thirteenth century, who were
associated for the purpose of suppressing
those bands of robbers which infested the
public roads in France; the <em>brethren of
the order of the redemption</em>, for redeeming
slaves from the Mahometans; the
<em>order of St. Anthony</em>, first established for
the relief of the poor under certain disorders;
and the <em>brethren and sisters of
the pious and christian schools</em>, for educating
poor children. These supplied
the place of hospitals and other such foundations,
which are now established on the
broader basis of public benevolence. To
bind up the wounds of the stranger, was
peculiarly the office of the inhabitants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the convent; and they often shared
the charities they received. The exercise
of hospitality is still their characteristic,
and must have been of particular use formerly,
when there were not the conveniences
and accommodations for travelling
which we now enjoy. The learned stranger
was always sure of an agreeable residence
amongst them; and as they all understood
Latin, they served him for interpreters, and
introduced him to a sight of whatever was
curious or valuable in the countries which
he visited. They checked the spirit of
savage fierceness, to which our warlike
ancestors were so prone, with the mildness
and sanctity of religious influences;
they preserved some respect to law and
order, and often decided controversies by
means less bloody than the sword, though
confessedly more superstitious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A proof</span> that these institutions had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
favourable aspect towards civilization,
may be drawn from a late history of
Ireland. “Soon after the introduction of
christianity into that kingdom,” says
Dr. Leland, “the monks fixed their habitations
in desarts, which they cultivated
with their own hands, and rendered
the most delightful spots in the
kingdom. These desarts became well
policed cities, and it is remarkable
enough, that to the monks we owe so
useful an institution in Ireland as the
bringing great numbers together into
one civil community. In these cities
the monks set up schools, and taught,
not only the youth of Ireland, but
the neighbouring nations; furnishing
them also with books. They became
umpires between contending chiefs,
and when they could not confine them
within the bounds of reason and religion,
at least terrified them by denouncing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
divine vengeance against their
excesses.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> it be considered too, that when the
minds of men began to open, some of the
most eminent reformers sprung from the
bosom of the church, and even of the
convent. It was not the laity who began
to think. The ecclesiastics were the first
to perceive the errors they had introduced.
The church was reformed from within, not
from without; and like the silk-worm,
when ripened in their cells to maturer vigour
and perfection, they pierced the
cloud themselves had spun, and within
which they had so long been enveloped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> let not the good protestant be too
much startled if I here venture to insinuate,
that the monasteries were schools of
some high and respectable virtues. Poverty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
chastity, and a renunciation of the
world, were certainly intended in the first
plan of these institutions; and though, from
the unavoidable frailty of human nature,
they were not always observed, certain
it is, that many individuals amongst
them have been striking examples of
the self-denying virtues: and as the influence
they acquired was only built
upon the voluntary homage of the
mind, it may be presumed such an ascendancy
was not originally gained without
some species of merit. The fondness
for monkery is easily deduced from some
of the best principles in the human heart.
It was indeed necessity, that in the
third century first drove the christians to
shelter themselves from the Decian persecution
in the solitary desarts of Thebais,
but the humour soon spread, and numbers
under the name of hermits, or eremites,
secluded themselves from the commerce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of mankind, choosing the wildest
solitudes, living in caves and hollows of
the rocks, and subsisting on such roots
and herbs as the ground afforded them.
About the fourth century they were gathered
into communities, and increased
with surprising rapidity. It was then that,
by a great and sudden revolution, the fury
of persecution had ceased, and the governing
powers were become friendly to
christianity. But the agitation of men’s
minds did not immediately subside with
the storm. The christians had so long experienced
the necessity of resigning all the
enjoyments of life, and were so detached
from every tie which might interfere with
the profession of their faith, that upon a
more favourable turn of affairs they hardly
dared open their minds to pleasurable
emotions. They thought the life of a
good man must be a continual warfare
between mind and body; and having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
long used to see ease and safety on the one
side, and virtue on the other, no wonder
if the association was so strong in their
minds, as to suggest the necessity of voluntary
mortification, and lead them to
inflict those sufferings upon themselves,
which they no longer apprehended from
others. They had continually experienced
the amazing effects of christianity in
supporting its followers under hardship,
tortures, and death; and they thought little
of its influence in regulating the common
behaviour of life, if it produced none
of those great exertions they had been used
to contemplate. They were struck with
the change from heathen licentiousness to
the purity of the gospel; and thought
they could never be far enough removed
from that bondage of the senses which it
had just cost them so violent a struggle to
escape. The minds of men were working
with newly-received opinions, not yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
mellowed into a rational faith; and the
young converts, astonished at the grandeur
and sublimity of the doctrines which
then first entered their hearts with irresistable
force, thought them worthy to engross
their whole attention. The mystic
dreams of the Platonist mingled with the
enthusiasm of the martyr; and it soon
became the prevailing opinion, that silence,
solitude, and contemplation, were
necessary for the reception of divine
truth. Mistaken ideas prevailed of a purity
and perfection far superior to the
rules of common life, which was only to
be attained by those who denied themselves
all the indulgences of sense; and
thus the ascetic severities of the cloister
succeeded in some degree to the philosophic
poverty of the Cynic school, and
the lofty virtues of the Stoic porch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indeed,</span> it is now the prevailing taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
in morals to decry every observance which
has the least appearance of rigour; and
to insist only on the softer virtues. But
let it be remembered, that self-command
and self-denial are as necessary to the
practice of benevolence, charity, and
compassion, as to any other duty; that it
is impossible to live to others without denying
ourselves; and that the man who
has not learned to curb his appetites and
passions is ill qualified for those sacrifices
which the friendly affections are continually
requiring of him. The man who
has that one quality of self-command will
find little difficulty in the practice of any
other duty; as, on the contrary, he who
has it not, tho’ possessed of the gentlest
feelings, and most refined sensibilities, will
soon find his benevolence sink into a mere
companionable easiness of temper, neither
useful to others nor happy for himself.
A noble enthusiasm is sometimes of use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
to show how far human nature can go.
Though it may not be proper, or desirable,
that numbers should seclude themselves
from the common duties and ordinary
avocations of life, for the austerer lessons
of the cloister, yet it is not unuseful that
some should push their virtues to even a
romantic height; and it is encouraging to
reflect in the hour of temptation, that the
love of ease, the aversion to pain, every
appetite and passion, and even the strongest
propensities in our nature, have been
controuled; that the empire of the mind
over the body has been asserted in its fullest
extent; and that there have been men in
all ages capable of voluntarily renouncing
all the world offers, voluntarily suffering
all it dreads, and living independent, and
unconnected with it. Nor was it a small
advantage, or ill calculated to support
the dignity of science, that a learned man
might be respectable in a coarse gown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
a leathern girdle, and bare-footed. Cardinal
Ximenes preserved the severe simplicity
of a convent amidst the pomp
and luxury of palaces; and to those who
thus thought it becoming in the highest
stations to affect the appearance of poverty,
the reality surely could not be
very dreadful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is yet another light in which
these institutions may be considered. It
is surely not improper to provide a retreat
for those who, stained by some deep
and enormous crime, wish to expiate by
severe and uncommon penitence those
offences which render them unworthy of
freer commerce with the world. Repentance
is never so secure from a relapse
as when it breaks off at once from every
former connection, and entering upon a
new course of life, bids adieu to every object
that might revive the idea of temptations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
which have once prevailed. In
these solemn retreats, the stillness and acknowledged
sanctity of the place, with
the striking novelty of every thing around
them, might have great influence in
calming the passions; might break the
force of habit, and suddenly induce a new
turn of thinking. There are likewise
afflictions so overwhelming to humanity,
that they leave no relish in the mind for
any thing else than to enjoy its own melancholy
in silence and solitude; and to
a heart torn with remorse, or opprest
with sorrow, the gloomy severities of La
Trappe are really a relief. Retirement
is also the favourite wish of age. Many
a statesman, and many a warrior, sick of
the bustle of that world to which they
had devoted the prime of their days, have
longed for some quiet cell, where, like
cardinal Wolsey, or Charles the Fifth, they
might shroud their grey hairs, and lose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
sight of the follies with which they had
been too much tainted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> there is, perhaps, less to
plead for immuring beauty in a cloister,
and confining that part of the species
who are formed to shine in families and
sweeten society, to the barren duties and
austere discipline of a monastic life; yet
circumstances might occur, in which
they would, even to a woman, be a welcome
refuge. A young female, whom
accident or war had deprived of her
natural protectors, must, in an age of
barbarism, be peculiarly exposed and
helpless. A convent offered her an asylum
where she might be safe, at least, if
not happy; and add to the consciousness
of unviolated virtue the flattering dreams
of angelic purity and perfection. There
were orders, as well amongst the women
as the men, instituted for charitable purposes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
such as that of the <em>Virgins of love</em>,
or <em>Daughters of mercy</em>, founded in 1660,
for the relief of the sick poor; with
others for instructing their children.
These must have been peculiarly suited
to the softness and compassion of the sex,
and to this it is no doubt owing, that
still, in catholic countries, ladies of the
highest rank often visit the hospitals and
houses of the poor; waiting on them with
the most tender assiduity, and performing
such offices as our protestant ladies
would be shocked at the thoughts of.
We should also consider, that most of the
females who now take the veil, are such
as have no agreeable prospects in life.
Why should not these be allowed to quit
a world which will never miss them? It is
easier to retire from the public, than to
support its disregard. The convent is to
them a shelter from poverty and neglect.
Their little community grows dear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
them. The equality which subsists among
these sisters of obscurity, the similarity
of their fate, the peace, the leisure they
enjoy, give rise to the most endearing
friendships. Their innocence is shielded
by the simplicity of their life from even
the idea of ill; and they are flattered by
the notion of a voluntary renunciation of
pleasures, which, probably, had they continued
in the world, they would have had
little share in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> all that can be said, we have
reason enough to rejoice that the superstitions
of former times are now fallen
into disrepute. What might be a palliative
at one time, soon became a crying
evil in itself. When the fuller day of
science began to dawn, the monkish
orders were willing to exclude its brightness,
that the dim lamp might still glimmer
in their cell. Their growing vices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
have rendered them justly odious to
society, and they seem in a fair way of
being for ever abolished. But may we
not still hope that the world was better
than it would have been without them;
and that he, who knows to bring good
out of evil, has made them, in their day,
subservient to some useful purposes. The
corruptions of christianity, which have
been accumulating for so many ages,
seem to be now gradually clearing away,
and some future period may perhaps
exhibit our religion in all its native
simplicity.</p>

<p><span class="upper">That</span> the exercise of our benevolent
feelings, as called forth by the view of
human afflictions, should be a source
of pleasure, cannot appear wonderful to
one who considers that relation between
the moral and natural system of man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
which has connected a degree of satisfaction
with every action or emotion
productive of the general welfare. The
painful sensation immediately arising
from a scene of misery, is so much
softened and alleviated by the reflex
sense of self-approbation attending virtuous
sympathy, that we find, on the
whole, a very exquisite and refined pleasure
remaining, which makes us desirous
of again being witnesses to such scenes,
instead of flying from them with disgust
and horror. It is obvious how greatly
such a provision must conduce to the
ends of mutual support and assistance.
But the apparent delight with which we
dwell upon objects of pure terror, where
our moral feelings are not in the least
concerned, and no passion seems to be
excited but the depressing one of fear, is
a paradox of the heart, much more
difficult of solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reality of this source of pleasure
seems evident from daily observation.
The greediness with which the tales of
ghosts and goblins, of murders, earthquakes,
fires, shipwrecks, and all the
most terrible disasters attending human
life, are devoured by every ear, must
have been generally remarked. Tragedy,
the most favourite work of fiction, has
taken a full share of those scenes; “it has
supt full with horrors,” and has, perhaps,
been more indebted to them for
public admiration than to its tender and
pathetic part. The ghost of Hamlet,
Macbeth descending into the witches’
cave, and the tent scene in Richard,
command as forcibly the attention of our
souls as the parting of Jaffier and Belvidera,
the fall of Wolsey, or the death
of Shore. The inspiration of <em>terror</em> was
by the ancient critics assigned as the peculiar
province of tragedy; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Greek and Roman tragedians have introduced
some extraordinary personages for
this purpose: not only the shades of the
dead, but the furies, and other fabulous
inhabitants of the infernal regions. Collins,
in his most poetical ode to Fear, has
finely enforced this idea.</p>

 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old Gothic romance and the
Eastern tale, with their genii, giants, enchantments,
and transformations, however
a refined critic may censure them
as absurd and extravagant, will ever retain
a most powerful influence on the
mind, and interest the reader, independently
of all peculiarity of taste. Thus
the great Milton, who had a strong bias
to these wildnesses of the imagination,
has, with striking effect, made the stories
“of forests and enchantments drear,” a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
favourite subject with his <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Penseroso</cite>; and
had undoubtedly their awakening images
strong upon his mind when he breaks
out,</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> are we then to account for the
pleasure derived from such objects? I
have often been led to imagine that there
is a deception in these cases; and that the
avidity with which we attend is not a
proof of our receiving real pleasure. The
pain of suspense, and the irresistible desire
of satisfying curiosity, when once
raised, will account for our eagerness to
go quite through an adventure, though
we suffer actual pain during the whole
course of it. We rather choose to suffer
the smart pang of a violent emotion than
the uneasy craving of an unsatisfied desire.
That this principle, in many instances,
may involuntarily carry us through what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
we dislike, I am convinced from experience.
This is the impulse which renders
the poorest and most insipid narrative
interesting when once we get fairly
into it; and I have frequently felt it with
regard to our modern novels, which, if
lying on my table, and taken up in an
idle hour, have led me through the most
tedious and disgusting pages, while, like
Pistol eating his leek, I have swallowed
and execrated to the end. And it will not
only force us through dulness, but through
actual torture&mdash;through the relation of a
Damien’s execution, or an inquisitor’s
act of faith. When children, therefore,
listen with pale and mute attention to the
frightful stories of apparitions, we are
not, perhaps, to imagine that they are
in a state of enjoyment, any more than
the poor bird which is dropping into
the mouth of the rattlesnake; they are
chained by the ears, and fascinated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
curiosity. This solution, however, does
not satisfy me with respect to the well-wrought
scenes of artificial terror which
are formed by a sublime and vigorous
imagination. Here, though we know
before-hand what to expect, we enter
into them with eagerness, in quest of a
pleasure already experienced. This is
the pleasure constantly attached to the
excitement of surprise from new and
wonderful objects. A strange and unexpected
event awakens the mind, and
keeps it on the stretch; and where the
agency of invisible beings is introduced,
of “forms unseen, and mightier far than
we,” our imagination, darting forth, explores
with rapture the new world which
is laid open to its view, and rejoices in
the expansion of its powers. Passion and
fancy co-operating, elevate the soul to
its highest pitch; and the pain of terror
is lost in amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hence,</span> the more wild, fanciful, and
extraordinary are the circumstances of a
scene of horror, the more pleasure we
receive from it; and where they are too
near common nature, though violently
borne by curiosity through the adventure,
we cannot repeat it, or reflect on it,
without an over-balance of pain. In the
<cite>Arabian Nights</cite> are many most striking
examples of the terrible, joined with the
marvellous: the story of Aladdin, and the
travels of Sinbad, are particularly excellent.
The <cite>Castle of Otranto</cite> is a very
spirited modern attempt upon the same
plan of mixed terror, adapted to the
model of Gothic romance. The best
conceived, and the most strongly worked-up
scene of mere natural horror that I
recollect, is in Smolett’s <cite>Ferdinand Count
Fathom</cite>; where the hero, entertained in a
lone house in a forest, finds a corpse just
slaughtered in the room where he is sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
to sleep, and the door of which is locked
upon him. It may be amusing for the
reader to compare his feelings upon these,
and from thence form his opinion of the
justness of my theory. The following
fragment, in which both these manners
are attempted to be in some degree
united, is offered to entertain a solitary
winter’s evening.</p>

<hr class="story" />

<p class="no_indent">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<span class="smcap">After</span> this adventure, Sir
Bertrand turned his steed towards the
wolds, hoping to cross these dreary moors
before the curfew. But ere he had proceeded
half his journey, he was bewildered
by the different tracks, and not being
able, as far as the eye could reach, to espy
any object but the brown heath surrounding
him, he was at length quite uncertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
which way he should direct his course.
Night overtook him in this situation. It
was one of those nights when the moon
gives a faint glimmering of light through
the thick black clouds of a lowering sky.
Now and then she suddenly emerged in
full splendor from her veil; and then instantly
retired behind it, having just served
to give the forlorn Sir Bertrand a wide
extended prospect over the desolate waste.
Hope and native courage a while urged
him to push forwards, but at length the
increasing darkness and fatigue of body
and mind overcame him; he dreaded
moving from the ground he stood on,
for fear of unknown pits and bogs, and
alighting from his horse in despair, he
threw himself on the ground. He had
not long continued in that posture when
the sullen toll of a distant bell struck his
ears&mdash;he started up, and, turning towards
the sound, discerned a dim twinkling light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Instantly he seized his horse’s bridle, and
with cautious steps advanced towards it.
After a painful march, he was stopt by a
moated ditch surrounding the place from
whence the light proceeded; and by a
momentary glimpse of moon-light he had
a full view of a large antique mansion,
with turrets at the corners, and an ample
porch in the center. The injuries of time
were strongly marked on every thing
about it. The roof in various places was
fallen in, the battlements were half demolished,
and the windows broken and dismantled.
A draw-bridge, with a ruinous
gate-way at each end, led to the court
before the building. He entered, and
instantly the light, which proceeded from
a window in one of the turrets, glided
along and vanished; at the same moment
the moon sunk beneath a black cloud,
and the night was darker than ever. All
was silent. Sir Bertrand fastened his steed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
under a shed, and approaching the house,
traversed its whole front with light and
slow footsteps. All was still as death.
He looked in at the lower windows,
but could not distinguish a single object
through the impenetrable gloom.
After a short parley with himself, he entered
the porch, and seizing a massy
iron knocker at the gate, lifted it up,
and hesitating, at length struck a loud
stroke. The noise resounded through
the whole mansion with hollow echoes.
All was still again. He repeated the
strokes more boldly, and louder&mdash;another
interval of silence ensued. A third
time he knocked, and a third time all
was still. He then fell back to some
distance, that he might discern whether
any light could be seen in the whole
front. It again appeared in the same
place, and quickly glided away as before.
At the same instant, a deep sullen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
toll sounded from the turret. Sir Bertrand’s
heart made a fearful stop&mdash;He
was a while motionless; then terror impelled
him to make some hasty steps
towards his steed; but shame stopt his
flight; and, urged by honour, and a resistless
desire of finishing the adventure,
he returned to the porch; and,
working up his soul to a full steadiness
of resolution, he drew forth his sword
with one hand, and with the other lifted
up the latch of the gate. The heavy
door, creaking upon its hinges, reluctantly
yielded to his hand&mdash;he applied
his shoulder to it, and forced it
open&mdash;he quitted it, and stept forward&mdash;the
door instantly shut with a thundering
clap. Sir Bertrand’s blood was
chilled&mdash;he turned back to find the
door, and it was long ere his trembling
hands could seize it&mdash;but his utmost
strength could not open it again. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
several ineffectual attempts, he looked
behind him, and beheld, across a hall,
upon a large staircase, a pale bluish
flame, which cast a dismal gleam of
light around. He again summoned
forth his courage, and advanced towards
it&mdash;It retired. He came to the foot of
the stairs, and, after a moment’s deliberation,
ascended. He went slowly
up, the flame retiring before him, till
he came to a wide gallery&mdash;The flame
proceeded along it, and he followed in
silent horror, treading lightly, for the
echoes of his footsteps startled him. It
led him to the foot of another staircase,
and then vanished. At the same
instant, another toll sounded from the
turret&mdash;Sir Bertrand felt it strike upon
his heart. He was now in total darkness,
and, with his arms extended, began
to ascend the second staircase. A dead
cold hand met his left hand, and firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
grasped it, drawing him forcibly forwards&mdash;he
endeavoured to disengage
himself, but could not&mdash;he made a furious
blow with his sword, and instantly
a loud shriek pierced his ears, and the
dead hand was left powerless in his&mdash;He
dropt it, and rushed forwards with a
desperate valour. The stairs were narrow
and winding, and interrupted by frequent
breaches, and loose fragments of stone.
The staircase grew narrower and narrower,
and at length terminated in a low
iron grate. Sir Bertrand pushed it open&mdash;it
led to an intricate winding passage, just
large enough to admit a person upon his
hands and knees. A faint glimmering
of light served to shew the nature of the
place. Sir Bertrand entered&mdash;A deep
hollow groan resounded from a distance
through the vault&mdash;He went forwards,
and proceeding beyond the first turning,
he discerned the same blue flame which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
had before conducted him. He followed
it. The vault, at length, suddenly
opened into a lofty gallery, in the
midst of which a figure appeared, completely
armed, thrusting forwards the
bloody stump of an arm, with a terrible
frown and menacing gesture, and
brandishing a sword in his hand. Sir
Bertrand undauntedly sprung forwards;
and, aiming a fierce blow at the figure,
it instantly vanished, letting fall a massy
iron key. The flame now rested upon a
pair of ample folding doors at the end
of the gallery. Sir Bertrand went up to
it, and applied the key to a brazen
lock. With difficulty he turned the
bolt. Instantly the doors flew open,
and discovered a large apartment, at the
end of which was a coffin rested upon
a bier, with a taper burning on each side
of it. Along the room, on both sides,
were gigantic statues of black marble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
attired in the Moorish habit, and holding
enormous sabres in their right hands.
Each of them reared his arm, and advanced
one leg forwards as the knight
entered; at the same moment, the lid
of the coffin flew open, and the bell
tolled. The flame still glided forwards,
and Sir Bertrand resolutely followed,
till he arrived within six paces of the
coffin. Suddenly, a lady in a shroud and
black veil rose up in it, and stretched
out her arms towards him; at the same
time, the statues clashed their sabres,
and advanced. Sir Bertrand flew to
the lady, and clasped her in his arms&mdash;she
threw up her veil, and kissed his
lips; and instantly the whole building
shook as with an earthquake, and fell
asunder with a horrible crash. Sir Bertrand
was thrown into a sudden trance,
and, on recovering, found himself seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
on a velvet sofa, in the most magnificent
room he had ever seen, lighted with
innumerable tapers, in lustres of pure
crystal. A sumptuous banquet was set
in the middle. The doors opening to
soft music, a lady of incomparable
beauty, attired with amazing splendor,
entered, surrounded by a troop of gay
nymphs, more fair than the Graces. She
advanced to the knight, and, falling
on her knees, thanked him as her deliverer.
The nymphs placed a garland of
laurel upon his head, and the lady led
him by the hand to the banquet, and
sat beside him. The nymphs placed
themselves at the table, and a numerous
train of servants entering, served up
the feast; delicious music playing all
the time. Sir Bertrand could not speak
for astonishment: he could only return
their honours by courteous looks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
gestures. After the banquet was finished,
all retired but the lady, who, leading
back the knight to the sofa, addressed
him in these words: .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A person</span> engaged in the pursuit of
literary fame must be severely mortified
on observing the very speedy neglect
into which writers of high merit so frequently
fall. The revolution of centuries,
the extinction of languages, the
vast convulsions which agitate a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
people, are causes which may well be
submitted to in overwhelming an author
with oblivion; but that in the same
country, with little variation of language
or manners, the delights of one
age should become utter strangers in the
next, is surely an immaturity of fate
which conveys reproach upon the inconstancy
of national taste. That noble
band, the English poets, have ample
reason for complaining to what unjust
guardians they have entrusted their renown.
While we crown the statue of
Shakespeare as the prince of dramatic
poets, shall we forget the works, and
almost the names of his contemporaries
who possessed so much of a kindred
spirit? Shall the Italian <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pastor Fido</cite> and
<cite>Amyntas</cite> stand high in our estimation,
and the <cite>Faithful Shepherdess</cite>, the most
beautiful pastoral that a poet’s fancy ever
formed, be scarcely known amongst us?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Shall we feel the fire of heroic poetry
in translations from Greece and Rome,
and never search for it in the native productions
of our own country?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> capital work of Sir <em>William
D’Avenant</em>, which I now desire to call
forth from its obscurity, may well be
considered as in a state of oblivion, since
we no where meet with allusions to it, or
quotations from it, in our modern writers;
and few, I imagine, even of the professed
students in English classics, would think
their taste discredited by confessing that
they had never read <strong class="smcap"><cite class="plain">Gondibert</cite></strong>. A very
learned and ingenious critic, in his well-known
<cite>discourse upon poetical imitation</cite>,
has, indeed, taken notice of this poem;
but, though he bestows all due praise
upon its author, yet the purpose for
which it is mentioned being to instance
an essential error, we cannot suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
his authority has served to gain it more
readers. Having very judiciously laid
it down as a general observation, that
writers, by studiously avoiding the fancied
disgrace of imitation, are apt to
fall into improper method, forced conceits,
and affected expression; he proceeds
to introduce the work in question
after the following manner: “And, that
the reader may not suspect me of
asserting this without experience, let
me exemplify what has been here said
in the case of a very eminent person,
who, with all the advantages of art
and nature that could be required
to adorn the true poet, was ruined
by this single error. The person I
mean was <strong class="smcap">Sir William D’avenant</strong>,
whose <cite>Gondibert</cite> will remain a perpetual
monument of the mischiefs
which must ever arise from this affectation
of originality in lettered and
polite poets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A considerable</span> degree of deference
is undoubtedly due to a critic of such acknowledged
taste and abilities; yet, since
it appears to me, that in this instance he
writes under the influence of system and
learned prejudice, I shall venture to canvass
the principles upon which he supports
his censure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <em>method</em> of <cite class="plain">Gondibert</cite> is first objected
to by Dr. Hurd, and upon two
accounts. First, that the compass of the
poem is contracted from the limits of
the ancient epic, to those of the dramatic
form; and by this means, pursuing a close
accelerated plot, the opportunity is lost
of introducing digressive ornaments, and
of giving that minuteness of description
which confers an air of reality. Now,
since the author sets out with disavowing
the common rules of epic poetry, it is
certainly unjust to try him by those rules.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
That effects are not produced which he
never designed to produce, can be no matter
of blame; we have only to examine the
justness of the design itself. It is wrong
to expect incompatible qualities as well
in compositions as in men. A work cannot
at the same time possess force and
diffusiveness, rapidity and minuteness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> one who has read Homer without
prejudice, will, I doubt not, confess
that the effects which should result from
the great events of the story are much
broken and impeded by that very minuteness
of description, and frequency of digression
which D’avenant is blamed for
rejecting. The mind, warmed by an interesting
narration, either in history,
poetry, or romance, requires the writer
to keep up with its exertions, and cannot
bear him to flag in his pace, or turn aside
in pursuit of other objects. The proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
end of epic poetry, according to Dr.
Hurd, is <em>admiration</em>. This, I imagine,
would by no means have been allowed
by our author, who seems rather to have
placed it in interesting the passions, inculcating
noble sentiments, and informing
the understanding: nor does it answer
the idea of Horace, who praises Homer
for his moral lessons, for teaching</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry"  lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">&mdash;&mdash; Quid sit pulcrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="no_indent">However, a due limitation of subject, and
something of rapidity in pursuing it, appear
very necessary to the production of a
considerable effect, of what kind soever;
and a pompous display of foreign circumstances
must always debilitate more than
adorn. It appears an extremely bad compliment
to an epic poem, to say that its
chief beauty lies in the episodes. Indeed,
epic poetry, as existing in the models of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
antiquity, or their copies, by no means,
I think, deserves the title given by critics,
of the highest species of poetical composition.
The tedious compass of the
subject, the necessity of employing so
large a share of the work in the relation
of trifling occurrences for the sake of
connexion, and the frequency of interruptions
from collateral matter, inevitably
cause both the poet’s exertions and the
reader’s attention to intermit; and it is
no wonder that Homer, and Virgil too,
sometimes nod over their labours. The
author of <cite class="plain">Gondibert</cite> seems to have been
sensible of these inconveniences, and
upon fair comparison of the epic and
dramatic form, to have preferred the
latter, as capable of more spirit, and uniform
dignity. We shall find, however,
in reviewing the poem, that he has by no
means restricted himself so narrowly as
to preclude all ornamental deviations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and though they may not deserve the
title of episodes, yet in his short and
unfinished piece, they have all the desirable
effect of a pleasing variety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> second objection which Dr. Hurd
brings against the <em>method</em> of this poem, is
the rejection of all supernatural agency,
or what constitutes the <em>machinery</em> of the
ancient epic poem. But for this the critic
himself offers a vindication, when he commends
the author for not running into
the wild fables of the Italian romances,
“which had too slender a foundation in
the serious belief of his age to justify a
relation to them.” Now, by making
this <em>belief</em> an essential rule of propriety
with respect to the machinery, an author
in an enlightened period, such as that of
D’avenant, is, in effect, prohibited from
its use altogether; for the abstracted nature
of a pure and philosophical religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
renders it utterly unfit for the purposes
of poetical fiction. The works of such
Christian poets as have attempted to form
a system of machinery upon the ideas of
saints, angels, and tutelary spirits, will
sufficiently prove that their religion, even
with a mixture of popular superstition,
was ill calculated to assist their imagination.
Two writers, whom one would little
expect to meet upon the same ground,
Sir Richard Blackmore and Mons. Voltaire,
have given instances of the same
faulty plan in this respect; and nothing
in the good Knight’s epic labours can
more deserve the attack of ridicule, than
the divine mission in the Henriade for
instructing his Majesty in the sublime
mysteries of transubstantiation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a very just charge which Plato
brought against Homer, that he had
greatly contributed to debase religion by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the unworthy and absurd representations
he has given of the celestial beings, both
with respect to their power and their
justice; and this is a fault which the
poet must always in some measure be
guilty of, when he too familiarly mixes
divine agency with human events. Nor
does it appear more favourable to the
greatness of the human personages that
they are on all occasions so beholden to
the immediate interposition of divine
allies. The refined and judicious Virgil,
though he has tolerably kept up the dignity
of his Deities, has yet very much
lowered his heroes from this cause. When
we see Æneas, the son of a Goddess, aided
by a God, and covered with celestial
armour, with difficulty vanquishing the
gallant Turnus, we conclude, that without
such odds, the victory must have fallen on
the other side. Under such a system of
supernatural agency, there was no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
way of exalting a man than making him,
like Diomed, war against the Gods, or,
like Cato, approve a cause which they had
unjustly condemned. Surely, a “<em>sober</em>
intermixture of religion” can never be
attributed to the ancient epic. The poem
of <cite class="plain">Gondibert</cite> is, indeed, without all this
mixture of religious machinery, whether
it be termed sober or extravagant. Human
means are brought to accomplish
human ends; and Cowley, in his recommendatory
lines prefixed to the work,
has thus expressed his approbation of this
part of the plan.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> shall see hereafter, that the author
has not neglected to introduce <em>religious
sentiment</em>, and that of a more noble and
elevated kind than can easily be paralleled
in poetry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> as the poet, in the critic’s opinion,
did too much in banishing every thing
supernatural in the events, so he did too
little in retaining the fantastic notions of
love and honour in the characters of his
piece, which were derived from the same
source of fiction and romance. There is,
however, an essential difference between
the cases. Artificial sentiments, however
unnatural at first, may, from the operation
of particular causes, become so familiar
as to be adopted into the manners
of the age. Instances of fashion in sentiment
are almost as frequent as of fashion
in dress. It is certain that the romantic
ideas of love and honour did in fact prevail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
in a high degree during a considerable
period of the later ages, owing
to causes which the same ingenious critic
has in a very curious manner investigated,
in his <cite>letters on Chivalry and Romance</cite>.
They gave the leading tone to all polished
manners; and gallantry was as
serious a principle in the Italian courts,
as love to their country in the states of
Greece or old Rome. Supernatural
agency in human events, on the other
hand, however commonly pretended, or
firmly believed, would never approach
one step nearer to reality. After all, the
author of <cite class="plain">Gondibert</cite> could not intend to
reduce his poem to mere history; but
he chose to take a poetical licence in the
dignity and elevation of his sentiments,
rather than in the marvellousness of its
events. He thought he might attribute
to the exalted personages of courts and
camps the same nobleness of mind which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
himself, a courtier and a soldier, possessed.
If his work be allowed less grand and
entertaining from the want of such ornaments
as those of his predecessors are decorated
with, it will yet be difficult to
shew how, at his time, they could have
been applied consistently with good sense
and improved taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> much in vindication of the general
<em>method</em> of Sir W. D’avenant’s poem.
With respect to its <em>execution</em>, the justice
of Dr. Hurd’s censure cannot be controverted.
That his sentiments are frequently
far-fetched and affected, and his
expression quaint and obscure, is but too
obviously apparent; and these faults, together
with the want of harmony in versification,
will sufficiently account for the
neglect into which the work is fallen,
though interesting in its story, and thick
sown with beauties. Readers who take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
up a book merely for the indolent amusement
of a leisure hour, cannot endure the
labour of unharbouring a fine thought
from the cover of perplexed expression.
The <em>pleasure</em> arising from a flowing line,
or a rounded period, is more engaging to
them, because more easily enjoyed, than
that from a sublime or witty conception.
The author’s faulty <em>execution</em>, however,
arose from a source directly contrary to
the “dread of imitation.” Imitation
itself led him to it; for almost all the
models of polite literature existing in his
own country, and indeed in the other
polished nations of Europe, were characterized
by the very same vitiation of
taste. Among our own writers, it is
sufficient to instance Donne, Suckling and
Cowley, for this constant affectation of
wit and uncommon sentiment, and for a
consequent obscurity of expression. Yet
all these, and Sir W. D’avenant, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
in a more eminent degree than the rest,
had for great occasions, above the temptation
of trifling, a majestic and nervous
simplicity, both of sentiment and expression;
which, with our more refined
taste and language, we have never been
able to equal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I should</span> now hope that the reader
would set out with me upon a nearer inspection
of this poem, with the general
<em>idea</em> of its being the work of an elevated
genius, pregnant with a rich store of free
and noble sentiment, fashioned by an intimate
commerce with the great world,
and boldly pursuing an original, but not
an unskilful plan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> measure chosen for this poem is
that which we now almost confine to
elegy. This choice does not appear very
judicious; for, although our elegiac stanza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
possesses a strength and fulness which renders
it not unsuitable to heroic subjects,
yet, in a piece of considerable length,
every returning measure must become
tiresome from its frequent repetitions.
And this is not the worst effect of returning
stanzas, in a long work. The
necessity of comprizing a sentence within
the limits of the measure is the tyranny of
Procrustes to thought. For the sake of a
disagreeable uniformity, expression must
constantly be cramped or extended. In
general, the latter expedient will be practised,
as the easiest; and thus both sentiment
and language will be enfeebled by
unmeaning expletives. This, indeed, in
some measure, is the effect of rhyme
couplets; and still more of the Latin
hexameter and pentameter. In our author,
a redundancy of thought, running out
into parentheses, seems to have been produced,
or at least encouraged by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
measure. But I think he has generally
preserved a force and majesty of expression.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would have been highly injudicious
for one who has rejected all poetical machinery,
to have begun his poem with
the ancient form of invoking a Muse. Indeed,
in all modern writers this invocation
appears little better than an unmeaning
ceremony, practised by rote from ancient
custom; and very properly makes a part
of the <em>receipt for an epic poem</em> humourously
laid down after the exact model of mechanical
imitation, in the Spectator. Our
author, with simple and unaffected dignity,
thus opens at once into his subject:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> these great rivals, Gondibert was
he whom the king had destined for his
son-in-law, and the heir of his throne;
and Rhodalind too, in the privacy of her
own breast, had made the same choice.
This is related in a manner little inferior
to Shakespear’s famous description
of concealed love.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gondibert,</span> however, though of a
nature by no means unsusceptible of the
tender passion, had not as yet felt it for a
particular object; and Oswald, who stood
forth as the public suitor to the princess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
was incited by no other motive than
ambition. Not Rhodalind herself (says
the poet)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry poetry_2_indent">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">Could he affect, but shining in her throne.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">His</span> cause was powerfully pleaded with
the princess by his sister Gartha, with
whom we are next brought acquainted.
A bold, full, majestic beauty; and a
corresponding mind, high, restless, and
aspiring, are her distinguishing features.
The prince and duke were urged on to
ambitious pursuits by their respective
armies, which, just returned from conquest,
lay encamped, the one at Brescia,
and the other at Bergamo. That of
Gondibert was composed of hardy youth
whom he had selected from his father’s
camp, and educated in martial discipline
under his own inspection. Temperance,
chastity, vigilance, humanity, and all the
high virtues of chivalry, remarkably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
distinguish these young soldiers from
those of later times. Beauty, indeed,
commanded no less regard amongst them
than in a modern camp; but it was an
object of passion, and not of appetite;
and was the powerful engine in their
education which inspired them with noble
and exalted sentiments. This is an idea
on which our author, true to the principles
of chivalry, very frequently enlarges,
and always with peculiar force
and dignity. In the present instance
it is thus finely expressed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">But, though the Duke taught rigid discipline,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">He let them beauty thus at distance know;</div>
    <div class="p_line">As priests discover some more sacred shrine,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Which none must touch, yet all to it may bow.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">When thus, as suitors, mourning virgins pass</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Thro’ their clean camp, themselves in form they draw,</div>
    <div class="p_line">That they with martial reverence may grace</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Beauty, the stranger, which they seldom saw.</div>
  </div>
  <p class="pagenum in_poem"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></p>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">They vayl’d their ensigns as it by did move,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Whilst inward, as from native conscience, all</div>
    <div class="p_line">Worship’d the poet’s darling godhead, Love;</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Which grave philosophers did Nature call.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Indeed,</span> the influence of this passion
in its purest and most exalted state during
the course of education, is a subject that
might, perhaps, shine as much in the
hands of a moralist as of a poet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> soldiers of Oswald were his father’s
brave veterans, in whose arms he had been
bred. The story thus opened, and our
attention awakened to the expectation of
important events, the first canto is closed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> second canto introduces us to a
solemn annual hunting, held by Duke
Gondibert in commemoration of a great
victory gained on this day by his grandsire.
His train was adorned by many
gallant and noble persons, the friends of
his family, and commanders in his army.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
The hunting, which is described with
much poetical spirit, terminates in a combat.
As Gondibert and his party are returning
weary homeward, an ancient ranger
hastily brings the tidings that Oswald,
who had lain in ambush with a body of
chosen horse, is advancing upon them.
The Duke, rejecting all counsels of flight,
prepares to receive his foes; and with an
account of their principal leaders, and
the order of their march, the canto concludes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A parley</span> between the chiefs now succeeds,
in which the character of each is
well preserved. Oswald warmly accuses
his rival for usurping his claims on the
princess and the kingdom. Gondibert
defends himself with temper, and disavows
all ambitious designs. The other disdains
accommodation; and the conference ends
in a generous agreement to decide their
differences in single fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> every thing is prepared for the
combat, Hubert, the brother of Oswald,
steps forth with a general challenge to the
opposite party. This is instantly accepted,
and serves for a prelude to so many
others, that a general engagement seems
likely to ensue; when Oswald reproves
their disobedient ardour: and, upon Hubert’s
insisting to share his fate from the
rights of brotherhood, it is at length decided
that three persons of each party should
enter the lists along with their generals.
The duel then comes on, in the fourth
canto; in which Oswald, Hubert, Paradine
and Dargonet, are severally matched
with Gondibert; Hurgonil, the lover
of Orna, the Duke’s sister; and Arnold
and Hugo, generous rivals in Laura.
Descriptions of battle are so frequent in
epic poetry, that scarcely any circumstances
of variety are left to diversify them.
Homer and his imitators have attempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
novelty in the multiplicity of their combats
by every possible variation of
weapon, posture, and wound. They considered
the human body with anatomical
nicety; and dwelt with a savage pleasure
upon every idea of pain and horror that
studied butchery could excite. I shall
leave it to the professed admirers of antiquity
to determine under what head of
poetical beauty such objects are to be
ranged. The terrible is certainly a
principal source of the sublime; but
a slaughter-house or a surgery would not
seem proper studies for a poet. D’avenant
has drawn little from them. His battles
are rendered interesting chiefly by the
character and situation of the combatants.
When Arnold, the favoured lover of
Laura, is slain by Paradine, Hugo, who
had overthrown his antagonist, springs to
avenge his rival, with these truly gallant
expressions:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">

    <div class="p_line">Vain conqueror, said Hugo then, return!</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Instead of laurel, which the victor wears,</div>

    <div class="p_line_i2">And learn of me to water it with tears.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">Thy brother lost his life attempting mine;</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Which cannot for Lord Arnold’s loss suffice:</div>
    <div class="p_line">I must revenge, unlucky Paradine!</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">The blood his death will draw from Laura’s eyes.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">We rivals were in Laura; but, tho’ she</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">My griefs derided, his with sighs approv’d,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Yet I, in love’s exact integrity,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Must take thy life for killing him she lov’d.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">His</span> generosity, however, was fatal
both to his foe and himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hubert,</span> disabled by a wound in his
arm, is dishonoured by receiving his life
from his conqueror; upon which occasion
the poet thus beautifully apostrophises:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">O Honour, frail as life, thy fellow flower!</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Cherish’d, and watch’d, and hum’rously esteem’d,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Then worn for short adornments of an hour;</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">And is, when lost, no more than life redeem’d.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two chiefs are still left closely engaging;
and when Hurgonil approaches
to assist his lord, he is warmly commanded
to retire. At length, after many
mutual wounds, Oswald falls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> death of the Prince at the same
time takes off all restraint from his party,
and incites them to revenge. Led by
the wounded Hubert, old Vasco, and
Borgio, they attack the hunters, who, besides
the fatigue of the chace, are represented
as somewhat inferior in number.
A furious battle, the subject of the fifth
canto, now ensues. Gondibert shines
forth in all the splendor of a hero. By
his prowess his friends are rescued, and
the opposite leaders overthrown in various
separate encounters; and by his military
skill the brave veterans of Oswald
are defeated. The whole description of
the battle is warm and animated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>In Gondibert’s generous lamentation
over the fallen, every heart must sympathize
with the following pathetic tribute
to the rival lovers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">Brave Arnold and his rival strait remove,</div>

    <div class="p_line_i2">Since lover’s faith with these brave rivals dy’d.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">Say little Hugo never more shall mourn,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">In noble numbers, her unkind disdain;</div>
    <div class="p_line">Who now, not seeing beauty, feels no scorn;</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">When she with flowers Lord Arnold’s grave shall strew,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">And hears why Hugo’s life was thrown away,</div>
    <div class="p_line">She on that rival’s hearse will drop a few,</div>
    <div class="p_line_i2">Which merits all that April gives to May.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Duke now draws off his remaining
friends towards Bergamo: but on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
journey, overcome by fatigue and loss of
blood, he falls into a deadly swoon. His
attendants, amidst their anxiety and confusion
upon this event, are surprised, in
the sixth canto, with the approach of a
squadron of horse. This, however,
proves to be a friendly body, led by old
Ulfin, who, after recovering the Duke by
a cordial, declares himself to have been a
page to his grandsire, and gives a noble
relation of the character and exploits
of his great master. The rumour of
Oswald’s attack brought him to the relief
of Gondibert; and we have a description,
which will be thought too much bordering
upon the ludicrous, of the strange
confusion among his maimed veterans,
who in their haste had seized upon each
other’s artificial limbs. This unsightly
troop, with the deficiencies of hands,
arms, legs and eyes, can scarcely, with
all the poet’s art, be rendered a respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
object. Such instances of faulty
judgment are frequent in the writings of
an age which was characterized by vigour
of imagination rather than correctness of
taste. Ulfin leads the Duke to the house
of the sage Astragon, where, with the
approach of night, the canto and the first
book conclude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the beginning of the second book,
the poet carries us with Hurgonil and
Tybalt and their noble dead, to Verona.
The distant turrets first appearing, and
then the great objects opening, one by
one; the river, the palace, the temple, and
the amphitheatre of Flaminius, form a
landscape truly noble and picturesque.
The view of the temple gives occasion to
one of those elevated religious sentiments
which dignify this poem.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">This to soothe heaven the bloody Clephes built;</div>

    <div class="p_line_i2">That he would be a tyrant’s tenant here.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have then a lively description of
a city morning; with the various and
uncertain rumours of the late event,
among the people. The rest of the canto
is employed in a debate, rather tedious,
though intermixed with fine sentiments,
concerning the propriety of granting
funeral rites to those who had perished
in the quarrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> progress of the fatal news is
traced in the next canto. Aribert appears
sitting in council in all the regal
dignity. Tybalt relates the story.
The king, in a majestic speech, complains
of the toils and cares of empire,
and predicts the baneful consequences
likely to ensue. A more interesting scene
is then disclosed, in which Tybalt declares
the melancholy events of the combat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
to Rhodalind and the other ladies of
the court. Great art is shewn in the
delicate ambiguity by which they are
prepared to receive the tidings. Laura
is overpowered by her loss; and, calling
on Arnold’s name, is conveyed away by
her female attendants. This tender scene
of sorrow is finely contrasted by the
abrupt entrance of Gartha, in all the
wild pomp of mingled rage and grief.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">No sooner was the pity’d Laura gone,</div>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> third canto brings us to Brescia,
where Hubert’s arrival with the dead
body of Oswald excites every emotion of
surprize, grief and fury in the breasts of
the brave veterans. They spend the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
in this storm of contending passions;
and at day-break assemble round the tent
of Hubert, who by a noble harangue
gives additional fire to their revenge.
They instantly arm, and demand to be
led to Bergamo; when Gartha arrives.
She turns their vengeance against the
court, where she represents the triumph
of Gondibert’s faction, and the dishonour
cast upon their own. The rage discovered
in her countenance, overpowering
the symptoms of grief, is painted
with amazing grandeur in the following
simile:</p>

    <div class="p_line">The Sun did thus to threat’ned nature show</div>

    <div class="p_line_i2">And then shrunk back to let that anger fall.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> tempest is, however, allayed in
the next canto by the arrival of the wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Hermegild; who, though grown aged in
war and politics, is possessed with a youthful
passion for Gartha. He solemnly
binds his services to their party, for the
reward of Gartha’s love; but persuades
them to submit to more cautious and pacific
measures. Gartha returns with him
to the court; and the funeral of Oswald
with Roman rites, “Which yet the world’s
last law had not forbid,” is described in
the remaining part of the canto.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> scenes of rage and tumult the
poet then leads us to the quiet shades of
philosophy in the house of Astragon.
This change is not better calculated for
the reader’s relief, than for a display of
the richness and elevation of the writer’s
mind. That the friend of Hobbes should
despise the learned lumber of the schools
will not be thought extraordinary; but
that he should distinctly mark out such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
plans of acquiring knowledge as have
since been pursued with the greatest success,
may well be deemed a remarkable proof
of high and comprehensive genius.
In Astragon’s domain is a retired building,
upon which is written in large letters,
<strong class="allcap">GREAT NATURE’S OFFICE</strong>. Here sit
certain venerable sages, stiled <em>Nature’s
Registers</em>, busied in recording what is
brought them by a throng called their
<em>Intelligencers</em>. These men are diversly
employed in exploring the haunts of
beasts, of birds, and of fishes, and collecting
observations of their manners,
their prey, their increase, and every circumstance
of their œconomy. Near this
place is <strong class="allcap">NATURE’S NURSERY</strong>, stocked
with every species of plants, of which
the several properties and virtues are diligently
examined. Is it not striking to
find, in the <em>house of Astragon</em> so exact a

of what is truly valuable in learning.
Of this, his account of the polemic

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the subjects of this canto appear
more noble and elevated than those which
usually employ the episodes of heroic
poetry, that of the ensuing one must
strike with still superior dignity. Having
acquainted us with the philosophy of his
admired sage, the poet now, by a beautiful
kind of allegory, instructs us in his
religion. Astragon had dedicated three temples,
to <strong class="allcap">PRAYER</strong>, to <strong class="allcap">PENITENCE</strong>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
to <strong class="allcap">PRAISE</strong>. The <em>Temple of Prayer</em> is described
as a building quite plain, open,
and without bells; since nothing should
tempt or summon to an office to which
our own wants invite us. The duty of
<em>Penitence</em> being a severity unpleasing to
nature, its <em>temple</em> is contrived, by its
solemn and uncommon appearance, to
catch the sense. It is a vast building of
black marble, hung with black, and
furnished with that “dim religious light”
which poets have so finely employed to
excite kindred ideas of gloom and melancholy:
but none, I think, have painted
it with such strength of colouring as our
author:</p>

every other circumstance belonging to it
is imagined with great propriety and
beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the poet’s greatest exertions are
reserved for his favourite <em>temple of Praise</em>.
A general shout of joy is the summons to
it. The building, in its materials and
architecture, is gay and splendid beyond
the most sumptuous palace. The front
is adorned with figures of all kinds of
musical instruments; all, as he most
beautifully expresses it,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> the unpractised Birtha should

whose want of ambition alone had secured
him from the charms of Rhodalind,
should bow to those of his lovely
hostess and handmaid, will be thought a
very natural turn in the story; upon
which, however, the reader may foresee
the most interesting events depending.
The progress of their love, though
scarcely known to themselves, is soon
discovered by the sage Astragon. This is
expressed by the poet with a very fine
turn of a common thought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> remainder of this poem, consisting
of a third book, written during the
author’s imprisonment, is composed of
several detached scenes, in which the
main plot lies ripening for future action.
Rivals are raised to Birtha. Flattering
advances from the court, and more open
declarations of love from Rhodalind, are
in vain employed to assail the constancy
of Gondibert. Various conflicts of passion
arise, and interesting situations, well
imagined, and painted in lively colours.
Much is given, as in the former parts,
to the introduction of elevated sentiment;
with one example of which I shall
finish my quotations. Several well-born
youths are placed about the person of
Gondibert as his pages, whose education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
consists of the following great lessons
from their lord:</p>

    <div class="p_line_i2">A desperate charge which ends in base retreat.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> plot is at length involved in so
many intricate and apparently unsurmountable
difficulties, that it is scarce
possible to conceive a satisfactory termination.
Perhaps the poet was sensible
of a want of power to extricate himself,
and chose thus to submit to a voluntary
bankruptcy of invention, rather than
hazard his reputation by going further.
In his postscript, indeed, he excuses himself
on account of sickness and approaching
dissolution. However disappointed
we may be by his abrupt departure from
scenes which he has filled with confusion,
we ought not to forget the pleasures already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
received from them. “If (says he
to his reader, with more than the spirit
of a dying man) thou art one of those
who has been warmed with poetic fire,
I reverence thee as my judge.” From
such a judicature, this <strong class="allcap">NOBLE FRAGMENT</strong>,
would, I doubt not, acquire for him what
the critic laments his having lost, “the

<span class="head_smallest word_sep">AGREEABLE SENSATIONS.</span></h2>

<p><span class="upper">It</span> is undoubtedly true, though a
phænomenon of the human mind difficult
to account for, that the representation
of distress frequently gives pleasure;
from which general observation many of
our modern writers of tragedy and romance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
seem to have drawn this inference,
that in order to please, they have
nothing more to do than to paint distress
in natural and striking colours. With
this view, they heap together all the
afflicting events and dismal accidents
their imagination can furnish; and when
they have half broke the reader’s heart,
they expect he should thank them for his
agreeable entertainment. An author of
this class sits down, pretty much like
an inquisitor, to compute how much
suffering he can inflict upon the hero
of his tale before he makes an end of
him; with this difference, indeed, that
the inquisitor only tortures those who
are at least reputed criminals; whereas
the writer generally chooses the most
excellent character in his piece for the
subject of his persecution. The great
criterion of excellence is placed in being
able to draw tears plentifully; and concluding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
we shall weep the more, the
more the picture is loaded with doleful
events, they go on, telling</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry poetry_2_indent">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; of sorrows upon sorrows</div>
    <div class="p_line">Even to a lamentable length of woe.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> monarch once proposed a reward
for the discovery of a new pleasure;
but if any one could find out a new
torture, or non-descript calamity, he
would be more entitled to the applause
of those who fabricated books of entertainment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the springs of pity require to be
touched with a more delicate hand; and
it is far from being true that we are agreeably
affected by every thing that excites
our sympathy. It shall therefore be the
business of this essay to distinguish those
kinds of distress which are pleasing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
representation, from those which are
really painful and disgusting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> view or relation of mere misery
can never be pleasing. We have, indeed,
a strong sympathy with all kinds of misery;
but it is a feeling of pure unmixed
pain, similar in kind, though not equal
in degree, to what we feel for ourselves
on the like occasions; and never produces
that melting sorrow, that thrill of tenderness,
to which we give the name of pity.
They are two distinct sensations, marked
by very different external expression.
One causes the nerves to tingle, the flesh
to shudder, and the whole countenance
to be thrown into strong contractions;
the other relaxes the frame, opens the
features, and produces tears. When we
crush a noxious or loathsome animal,
we may sympathize strongly with the
pain it suffers, but with far different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
emotions from the tender sentiment we
feel for the dog of Ulysses, who crawled
to meet his long-lost master, looked up,
and died at his feet. Extreme bodily
pain is perhaps the most intense suffering
we are capable of, and if the fellow-feeling
with misery alone was grateful to the
mind, the exhibition of a man in a fit of
the tooth-ach, or under a chirurgical
operation, would have a fine effect in a
tragedy. But there must be some other
sentiment combined with this kind of instinctive
sympathy, before it becomes in
any degree pleasing, or produces the
sweet emotion of pity. This sentiment is
love, esteem, the complacency we take
in the contemplation of beauty, of mental
or moral excellence, called forth and
rendered more interesting, by circumstances
of pain and danger. Tenderness
is, much more properly than sorrow, the
spring of tears; for it affects us in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
manner, whether combined with joy or
grief; perhaps more in the former case
than the latter. And I believe we may
venture to assert, that no distress which
produces tears is wholly without a mixture
of pleasure. When Joseph’s brethren
were sent to buy corn, if they had perished
in the desart by wild beasts, or been reduced
(as in the horrid adventures of a
Pierre de Vaud) to eat one another, we
might have shuddered, but we should not
have wept for them. The gush of tears
breaks forth when Joseph made himself
known to his brethren, and fell on their
neck, and kissed them. When Hubert
prepares to burn out prince Arthur’s
eyes, the shocking circumstance, of itself,
would only affect us with horror; it is
the amiable simplicity of the young
prince, and his innocent affection to his
intended murderer, that draws our tears,
and excites that tender sorrow which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
love to feel, and which refines the heart
while we do feel it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> see, therefore, from this view of
our internal feelings, that no scenes of
misery ought to be exhibited which are
not connected with the display of some
moral excellence, or agreeable quality.
If fortitude, power, and strength of mind
are called forth, they produce the sublime
feelings of wonder and admiration: if
the softer qualities of gentleness, grace,
and beauty, they inspire love and pity.
The management of these latter emotions
is our present object.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> let it be remembered, in the first
place, that the misfortunes which excite
pity must not be too horrid and overwhelming.
The mind is rather stunned
than softened by great calamities. They
are little circumstances that work most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
sensibly upon the tender feelings. For
this reason, a well-written novel generally
draws more tears than a tragedy. The
distresses of tragedy are more calculated
to amaze and terrify, than to move compassion.
Battles, torture and death are
in every page. The dignity of the characters,
the importance of the events,
the pomp of verse and imagery interest
the grander passions, and raise the mind
to an enthusiasm little favourable to the
weak and languid notes of pity. The
tragedies of Young are in a fine strain of
poetry, and the situations are worked up
with great energy; but the pictures are in
too deep a shade: all his pieces are full
of violent and gloomy passions, and so
over-wrought with horror, that instead of
awakening any pleasing sensibility, they
leave on the mind an impression of sadness
mixed with terror. Shakespeare is
sometimes guilty of presenting scenes too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
shocking. Such is the trampling out of
Gloster’s eyes; and such is the whole play
of Titus Andronicus. But Lee, beyond
all others, abounds with this kind of
images. He delighted in painting the
most daring crimes, and cruel massacres;
and though he has shewn himself extremely
capable of raising tenderness, he
continually checks its course by shocking
and disagreeable expressions. His pieces
are in the same taste with the pictures of
Spagnolet, and there are many scenes in
his tragedies which no one can relish who
would not look with pleasure on the slaying
of St. Bartholomew. The following
speech of Marguerite, in the massacre of
Paris, was, I suppose, intended to express
the utmost tenderness of affection.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Images</span> like these will never excite the
softer passions. We are less moved at the
description of an Indian tortured with all
the dreadful ingenuity of that savage
people, than with the fatal mistake of the
lover in the Spectator, who pierced an
artery in the arm of his mistress as he
was letting her blood. Tragedy and romance-writers
are likewise apt to make
too free with the more violent expressions
of passion and distress, by which means
they lose their effect. Thus an ordinary
author does not know how to express any
strong emotion otherwise than by swoonings
or death; so that a person experienced
in this kind of reading, when a
girl faints away at parting with her lover,
or a hero kills himself for the loss of
his mistress, considers it as the established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
etiquette upon such occasions, and turns
over the pages with the utmost coolness
and unconcern; whereas real sensibility,
and a more intimate knowledge of human
nature, would have suggested a thousand
little touches of grief, which though
slight, are irresistible. We are too gloomy
a people. Some of the French novels are
remarkable for little affecting incidents,
imagined with delicacy, and told with
grace. Perhaps they have a better turn
than we have for this kind of writing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A judicious</span> author will never attempt
to raise pity by any thing mean or disgusting.
As we have already observed,
there must be a degree of complacence
mixed with our sorrows to produce an
agreeable sympathy; nothing, therefore,
must be admitted which destroys the
grace and dignity of suffering; the imagination
must have an amiable figure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
dwell upon; there are circumstances so
ludicrous or disgusting, that no character
can preserve a proper decorum under
them, or appear in an agreeable light.

<p class="no_indent">Deformity is always disgusting, and the
imagination cannot reconcile it with the
idea of a favourite character; therefore
the poet and romance-writer are fully
justified in giving a larger share of beauty
to their principal figures than is usually
met with in common life. A late genius,
indeed, in a whimsical mood, gave us a
lady with her nose crushed for the heroine
of his story; but the circumstance spoils
the picture; and though in the course of
the story it is kept a good deal out of
sight, whenever it does recur to the imagination
we are hurt and disgusted. It
was an heroic instance of virtue in the
nuns of a certain abbey, who cut off
their noses and lips to avoid violation;
yet this would make a very bad subject
for a poem or a play. Something
akin to this is the representation of any
thing unnatural; of which kind is the
famous story of the Roman charity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
for this reason I cannot but think it an
unpleasing subject for either the pen or
the pencil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Poverty,</span> if truly represented, shocks
our nicer feelings; therefore, whenever
it is made use of to awaken our compassion,
the rags and dirt, the squalid appearance
and mean employments incident
to that state must be kept out of
sight, and the distress must arise from
the idea of depression, and the shock of
falling from higher fortunes. We do not
pity Belisarius as a poor blind beggar;
and a painter would succeed very ill who
should sink him to the meanness of that
condition. He must let us still discover
the conqueror of the Vandals, the general
of the imperial armies, or we shall be
little interested. Let us look at the picture
of the old woman in Otway:</p>

<p class="no_indent">Here is the extreme of wretchedness, and
instead of melting into pity, we should
turn away with disgust, if we were not
pleased with it, as we are with a Dutch
painting, from its exact imitation of nature.
Indeed the author only intended it
to strike horror. But how different are
the sentiments we feel for the lovely Belvidera!
We see none of those circumstances
which render poverty an unamiable
thing. When the goods are seized by an
execution, our attention is turned to <em>the
piles of massy plate, and all the ancient, most
domestic ornaments</em>, which imply grandeur
and consequence; or to such instances of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
their hard fortune as will lead us to pity
them as lovers: we are struck and affected
with the general face of ruin; but we are
not brought near enough to discern the
ugliness of its features. Belvidera ruined,
Belvidera deprived of friends, without a
home, abandoned to the wide world&mdash;we
can contemplate with all the pleasing
sympathy of pity; but had she been represented
as really sunk into low life, had
we seen her employed in the most servile
offices of poverty, our compassion would
have given way to contempt and disgust.
Indeed, we may observe in real life, that
poverty is only pitied so long as people
can keep themselves from the effects of
it. When in common language we say <em>a
miserable object</em>, we mean an object of
distress which, if we relieve, we turn
away from at the same time. To make
pity pleasing, the object of it must not in
any view be disagreeable to the imagination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
How admirably has the author of
Clarissa managed this point? Amidst
scenes of suffering which rend the heart,
in poverty, in a prison, under the most
shocking outrages, the grace and delicacy
of her character never suffers even for
a moment; there seems to be a charm
about her which prevents her receiving
a stain from anything which happens;
and Clarissa, abandoned and undone, is
the object not only of complacence, but
veneration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> would likewise observe, that if an
author would have us feel a strong degree
of compassion, his characters must
not be too perfect. The stern fortitude
and inflexible resolution of a Cato may
command esteem, but does not excite
tenderness; and faultless rectitude of conduct,
though no rigour be mixed with it,
is of too sublime a nature to inspire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
compassion. Virtue has a kind of self-sufficiency;
it stands upon its own basis,
and cannot be injured by any violence. It
must therefore be mixed with something
of helplessness and imperfection, with an
excessive sensibility, or a simplicity bordering
upon weakness, before it raises, in
any great degree, either tenderness or familiar
love. If there be a fault in the
masterly performance just now mentioned,
it is that the character of Clarissa is so inflexibly
right, her passions are under such
perfect command, and her prudence is so
equal to every occasion, that she seems
not to need that sympathy we should bestow
upon one of a less elevated character;
and perhaps we should feel a livelier emotion
of tenderness for the innocent girl
whom Lovelace calls his Rose-bud, but
that the story of Clarissa is so worked up
by the strength of colouring, and the force
of repeated impressions, as to command
all our sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pity</span> seems too degrading a sentiment
to be offered at the shrine of faultless
excellence. The sufferings of martyrs
are rather beheld with admiration and
sympathetic triumph than with tears;
and we never feel much for those whom
we consider as themselves raised above
common feelings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last rule I shall insist upon is,
that scenes of distress should not be too
long continued. All our finer feelings
are in a manner momentary, and no art
can carry them beyond a certain point,
either in intenseness or duration. Constant
suffering deadens the heart to tender
impressions; as we may observe in sailors,
and others who are grown callous by a
life of continual hardships. It is therefore
highly necessary, in a long work, to
relieve the mind by scenes of pleasure
and gaiety; and I cannot think it so absurd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
a practice as our modern delicacy
has represented it, to intermix wit and
fancy with the pathetic, provided care be
taken not to check the passions while they
are flowing. The transition from a pleasurable
state of mind to tender sorrow is
not so difficult as we imagine. When
the mind is opened by gay and agreeable
scenes, every impression is felt more sensibly.
Persons of a lively temper are
much more susceptible of that sudden
swell of sensibility which occasions tears,
than those of a grave and saturnine cast:
for this reason women are more easily
moved to weeping than men. Those
who have touched the springs of pity
with the finest hand, have mingled light
strokes of pleasantry and mirth in their
most pathetic passages. Very different is
the conduct of many novel-writers, who,
by plunging us into scenes of distress
without end or limit, exhaust the powers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
and before the conclusion either render
us insensible to every thing, or fix a real
sadness upon the mind. The uniform
stile of tragedies is one reason why they
affect so little. In our old plays, all the
force of language is reserved for the
more interesting parts; and in the scenes
of common life there is no attempt to
rise above common language: whereas
we, by that pompous manner and affected
solemnity which we think it necessary
to preserve through the whole
piece, lose the force of an elevated or
passionate expression where the occasion
really suggests it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus considered the manner
in which fictitious distress must be managed
to render it pleasing, let us reflect
a little upon the moral tendency of such
representations. Much has been said in
favour of them, and they are generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
thought to improve the tender and humane
feelings; but this, I own, appears
to me very dubious. That they exercise
sensibility, is true; but sensibility does not
increase with exercise. By the constitution
of our frame our habits increase, our
emotions decrease, by repeated acts; and
thus a wise provision is made, that as our
compassion grows weaker, its place should
be supplied by habitual benevolence. But
in these writings our sensibility is strongly
called forth without any possibility of exerting
itself in virtuous action, and those
emotions, which we shall never feel again
with equal force, are wasted without advantage.
Nothing is more dangerous
than to let virtuous impressions of any
kind pass through the mind without producing
their proper effect. The awakenings
of remorse, virtuous shame and indignation,
the glow of moral approbation&mdash;if
they do not lead to action, grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
less and less vivid every time they recur,
till at length the mind grows absolutely
callous. The being affected with a pathetic
story is undoubtedly a sign of an
amiable disposition, but perhaps no means
of increasing it. On the contrary, young
people, by a course of this kind of reading,
often acquire something of that
apathy and indifference which the experience
of real life would have given
them, without its advantages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> reason why plays and romances
do not improve our humanity is,
that they lead us to require a certain elegance
of manners and delicacy of virtue
which is not often found with poverty,
ignorance and meanness. The objects
of pity in romance are as different from
those in real life as our husbandmen from
the shepherds of Arcadia; and a girl
who will sit weeping the whole night at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the delicate distresses of a lady Charlotte,
or lady Julia, shall be little moved at
the complaint of her neighbour, who, in
a homely phrase and vulgar accent, laments
to her that she is not able to get
bread for her family. Romance-writers
likewise make great misfortunes so familiar
to our ears, that we have hardly
any pity to spare for the common accidents
of life: but we ought to remember,
that misery has a claim to relief,
however we may be disgusted with its appearance;
and that we must not fancy
ourselves charitable, when we are only
pleasing our imagination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would perhaps be better, if our
romances were more like those of the
old stamp, which tended to raise human
nature, and inspire a certain grace and
dignity of manners of which we have
hardly the idea. The high notions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
honour, the wild and fanciful spirit of
adventure and romantic love, elevated
the mind; our novels tend to depress
and enfeeble it. Yet there is a species of
this kind of writing which must ever
afford an exquisite pleasure to persons of
taste and sensibility; where noble sentiments
are mixed with well-fancied incidents,
pathetic touches with dignity
and grace, and invention with chaste
correctness. Such will ever interest our
sweetest passions. I shall conclude this
paper with the following tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="upper">In</span> the happy period of the golden
age, when all the celestial inhabitants
descended to the earth, and conversed
familiarly with mortals, among the most
cherished of the heavenly powers were
twins, the offspring of Jupiter, <strong class="allcap">LOVE</strong>
and <strong class="allcap">JOY</strong>. Where they appeared, the
flowers sprung up beneath their feet,
the sun shone with a brighter radiance,
and all nature seemed embellished by
their presence. They were inseparable
companions, and their growing attachment
was favoured by Jupiter, who
had decreed that a lasting union should
be solemnized between them as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
as they were arrived at maturer years.
But in the mean time the sons of men
deviated from their native innocence;
vice and ruin over-ran the earth with
giant strides; and Astrea, with her train
of celestial visitants, forsook their polluted
abodes. Love alone remained,
having been stolen away by Hope, who
was his nurse, and conveyed by her to
the forests of Arcadia, where he was
brought up among the shepherds. But
Jupiter assigned him a different partner,
and commanded him to espouse
<strong class="allcap">sorrow</strong>, the daughter of Até. He complied
with reluctance; for her features
were harsh and disagreeable, her eyes
sunk, her forehead contracted into perpetual
wrinkles, and her temples were
covered with a wreath of cypress and
wormwood. From this union sprung a
virgin, in whom might be traced a
strong resemblance to both her parents;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
but the sullen and unamiable features of
her mother were so mixed and blended
with the sweetness of her father, that
her countenance, though mournful, was
highly pleasing. The maids and shepherds
of the neighbouring plains gathered
round, and called her <strong class="allcap">PITY</strong>. A
red-breast was observed to build in the
cabin where she was born; and while she
was yet an infant, a dove, pursued by
a hawk, flew into her bosom. This
nymph had a dejected appearance, but
so soft and gentle a mien that she was
beloved to a degree of enthusiasm. Her
voice was low and plaintive, but inexpressibly
sweet; and she loved to lie
for hours together on the banks of some
wild and melancholy stream, singing to
her lute. She taught men to weep, for
she took a strange delight in tears; and
often, when the virgins of the hamlet
were assembled at their evening sports,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
she would steal in amongst them, and
captivate their hearts by her tales full
of a charming sadness. She wore on
her head a garland composed of her
father’s myrtles twisted with her mother’s
cypress.</p>

<p>One day, as she sat musing by the
waters of Helicon, her tears by chance
fell into the fountain; and ever since,
the Muses’ spring has retained a strong
taste of the infusion. Pity was commanded
by Jupiter to follow the steps of
her mother through the world, dropping
balm into the wounds she made, and
binding up the hearts she had broken.
She follows with her hair loose, her bosom
bare and throbbing, her garments
torn by the briars, and her feet bleeding
with the roughness of the path.
The nymph is mortal, for her mother
is so; and when she has fulfilled her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
destined course upon the earth, they shall
both expire together, and <strong class="allcap">LOVE</strong> be again
united to <strong class="allcap">JOY</strong>, his immortal and long-betrothed
bride.</p>

<p><span class="upper">It</span> is observed by a late most amiable
and elegant writer, that Religion may
be considered in three different views.
As a system of opinions, its sole object
is truth; and the only faculty that has
any thing to do with it is Reason, exerted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
in the freest and most dispassionate enquiry.
As a principle regulating our
conduct, Religion is a habit, and like all
other habits, of slow growth, and gaining
strength only by repeated exertions.
But it may likewise be considered as a
taste, an affair of sentiment and feeling,
and in this sense it is properly called
Devotion. Its seat is in the imagination
and the passions, and it has its source
in that relish for the sublime, the vast,
and the beautiful, by which we taste the
charms of poetry and other compositions
that address our finer feelings; rendered
more lively and interesting by a sense of
gratitude for personal benefits. It is in
a great degree constitutional, and is by
no means found in exact proportion to
the virtue of a character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is with relation to this last view of
the subject that the observations in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
essay are hazarded: for though, as a rule
of life, the authority and salutary effects
of religion are pretty universally acknowledged,
and though its tenets have been
defended with sufficient zeal, its affections
languish, the spirit of Devotion is certainly
at a very low ebb amongst us, and
what is surprising, it has fallen, I know
not how, into a certain contempt, and is
treated with great indifference, amongst
many of those who value themselves on
the purity of their faith, and who are
distinguished by the sweetness of their
morals. As the religious affections in a
great measure rise and fall with the pulse,
and are affected by every thing which
acts upon the imagination, they are apt
to run into strange excesses; and if directed
by a melancholy or enthusiastic
faith, their workings are often too strong
for a weak head, or a delicate frame;
and for this reason they have been almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
excluded from religious worship by many
persons of real piety. It is the character
of the present age to allow little to sentiment,
and all the warm and generous
emotions are treated as romantic by the
supercilious brow of a cold-hearted philosophy.
The man of science, with an
air of superiority, leaves them to some
florid declaimer who professes to work
upon the passions of the lower class,
where they are so debased by noise and
nonsense, that it is no wonder if they
move disgust in those of elegant and
better-informed minds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> there is a devotion, generous,
liberal, and humane, the child of more
exalted feelings than base minds can
enter into, which assimilates man to
higher natures, and lifts him “above
this visible diurnal sphere.” Its pleasures
are ultimate, and, when early cultivated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
continue vivid even in that uncomfortable
season of life when some of the
passions are extinct, when imagination is
dead, and the heart begins to contract
within itself. Those who want this taste,
want a sense, a part of their nature, and
should not presume to judge of feelings
to which they must ever be strangers.
No one pretends to be a judge in poetry
or the fine arts, who has not both a
natural and a cultivated relish for them;
and shall the narrow-minded children
of earth, absorbed in low pursuits, dare
to treat as visionary, objects which they
have never made themselves acquainted
with? Silence on such subjects will better
become them. But to vindicate the
pleasures of devotion to those who have
neither taste nor knowledge about them,
is not the present object. It rather deserves
our enquiry, what causes have
contributed to check the operations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
religious impressions amongst those who
have steady principles, and are well disposed
to virtue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And,</span> in the first place, there is nothing
more prejudicial to the feelings of
a devout heart, than a habit of disputing
on religious subjects. Free enquiry is
undoubtedly necessary to establish a rational
belief; but a disputatious spirit,
and fondness for controversy, give the
mind a sceptical turn, with an aptness to
call in question the most established
truths. It is impossible to preserve that
deep reverence for the Deity with which
we ought to regard him, when all his
attributes, and even his very existence,
become the subject of familiar debate.
Candor demands that a man should
allow his opponent an unlimited freedom
of speech, and it is not easy in the
heat of discourse to avoid falling into an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
indecent or careless expression; hence
those who think seldomer of religious
subjects, often treat them with more
respect than those whose profession keeps
them constantly in their view. A plain
man of a serious turn would probably be
shocked to hear questions of this nature
treated with that ease and negligence
with which they are generally discussed by
the practised Theologian, or the young
lively Academic ready primed from the
schools of logic and metaphysics. As the
ear loses its delicacy by being obliged
only to <em>hear</em> coarse and vulgar language,
so the veneration for religion wears off by
hearing it treated with disregard, though
we ourselves are employed in defending
it; and to this it is owing that many who
have confirmed themselves in the belief
of religion, have never been able to recover
that strong and affectionate sense of
it which they had before they began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
enquire, and have wondered to find their
devotion grown weaker when their faith
was better grounded. Indeed, strong
reasoning powers and quick feelings do
not often unite in the same person. Men
of a scientific turn seldom lay their hearts
open to impression. Previously biassed
by the love of system, they do indeed attend
the offices of religion, but they dare
not trust themselves with the preacher,
and are continually upon the watch to
observe whether every sentiment agrees
with their own particular tenets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> spirit of enquiry is easily distinguished
from the spirit of disputation. A
state of doubt is not a pleasant state. It
is painful, anxious, and distressing beyond
most others: it disposes the mind to dejection
and modesty. Whoever therefore
is so unfortunate as not to have settled
his opinions in important points, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
proceed in the search of truth with deep
humility, unaffected earnestness, and a
serious attention to every argument that
may be offered, which he will be much
rather inclined to revolve in his own
mind, than to use as materials for dispute.
Even with these dispositions, it is
happy for a man when he does not find
much to alter in the religious system he
has embraced; for if that undergoes a
total revolution, his religious feelings are
too generally so weakened by the shock,
that they hardly recover again their original
tone and vigour.</p>

enemy to religion? God forbid! Philosophy,</p>

<p>Yet there is a view in which she exerts
an influence perhaps rather unfavourable
to the fervor of simple piety. Philosophy
does indeed enlarge our conceptions of
the Deity, and gives us the sublimest
ideas of his power and extent of dominion;
but it raises him too high for
our imaginations to take hold of, and in
a great measure destroys that affectionate
regard which is felt by the common class
of pious Christians. When, after contemplating
the numerous productions of
this earth, the various forms of being,
the laws, the mode of their existence, we
rise yet higher, and turn our eyes to that
magnificent profusion of suns and systems
which astronomy pours upon the mind&mdash;When
we grow acquainted with the majestic
order of nature, and those eternal
laws which bind the material and intellectual
worlds&mdash;When we trace the
footsteps of creative energy through regions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
of unmeasured space, and still find
new wonders disclosed and pressing upon
the view&mdash;we grow giddy with the
prospect; the mind is astonished, confounded
at its own insignificance; we
think it almost impiety for a worm to
lift its head from the dust, and address
the Lord of so stupendous a universe;
the idea of communion with our Maker
shocks us as presumption, and the only
feeling the soul is capable of in such a
moment is a deep and painful sense of its
own abasement. It is true, the same philosophy
teaches that the Deity is intimately
present through every part of this
complicated system, and neglects not any
of his works: but this is a truth which is
believed without being felt; our imagination
cannot here keep pace with
our reason, and the sovereign of nature
seems ever further removed from us in
proportion as we enlarge the bounds of
his creation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philosophy</span> represents the Deity in
too abstracted a manner to engage our
affections. A Being without hatred and
without fondness, going on in one steady
course of even benevolence, neither delighted
with praises, nor moved by importunity,
does not interest us so much
as a character open to the feelings of indignation,
the soft relentings of mercy,
and the partialities of particular affections.
We require some common nature,
or at least the appearance of it, on
which to build our intercourse. It is also
a fault of which philosophers are often
guilty, that they dwell too much in generals.
Accustomed to reduce every
thing to the operation of general laws,
they turn our attention to larger views,
attempt to grasp the whole order of the
universe, and in the zeal of a systematic
spirit seldom leave room for those particular
and personal mercies which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
the food of gratitude. They trace the
great outline of nature, but neglect
the colouring which gives warmth and
beauty to the piece. As in poetry it is
not vague and general description, but a
few striking circumstances clearly related
and strongly worked up&mdash;as in a landscape
it is not such a vast extensive range
of country as pains the eye to stretch to
its limits, but a beautiful, well-defined
prospect, which gives the most pleasure&mdash;so
neither are those unbounded views in
which philosophy delights, so much calculated
to touch the heart as home views
and nearer objects. The philosopher
offers up general praises on the altar
of universal nature; the devout man, on
the altar of his heart, presents his own
sighs, his own thanksgivings, his own
earnest desires: the former worship is
more sublime, the latter more personal
and affecting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are likewise too scrupulous in our
public exercises, and too studious of
accuracy. A prayer strictly philosophical
must ever be a cold and dry composition.
From an over-anxious fear of admitting
any expression that is not strictly proper,
we are apt to reject all warm and pathetic
imagery, and, in short, every thing
that strikes upon the heart and the senses.
But it may be said, ‘If the Deity be indeed
so sublime a being, and if his designs
and manner are so infinitely beyond
our comprehension, how can a thinking
mind join in the addresses of the vulgar,
or avoid being overwhelmed with the
indistinct vastness of such an idea?’ Far
be it from me to deny that awe and
veneration must ever make a principal
part of our regards to the Master of the
universe, or to defend that style of indecent
familiarity which is yet more
shocking than indifference: but let it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
considered that we cannot hope to avoid
all improprieties in speaking of such a
Being; that the most philosophical address
we can frame is probably no more
free from them than the devotions of the
vulgar; that the scriptures set us an
example of accommodating the language
of prayer to common conceptions, and
making use of figures and modes of expression
far from being strictly defensible;
and that, upon the whole, it is safer to
trust to our genuine feelings, feelings
implanted in us by the God of nature,
than to any metaphysical subtleties. He
has impressed me with the idea of trust
and confidence, and my heart flies to him
in danger; of mercy to forgive, and I
melt before him in penitence; of bounty
to bestow, and I ask of him all I want
or wish for. I may make use of an inaccurate
expression, I may paint him to
my imagination too much in the fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
of humanity; but while my heart is
pure, while I depart not from the line
of moral duty, the error is not dangerous.
Too critical a spirit is the bane
of every thing great or pathetic. In our
creeds let us be guarded; let us there
weigh every syllable; but in compositions
addressed to the heart, let us give freer
scope to the language of the affections,
and the overflowing of a warm and generous
disposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> cause which most effectually
operates to check devotion, is ridicule.
I speak not here of open derision of things
sacred; but there is a certain ludicrous
style in talking of such subjects, which,
without any ill design, does much harm;
and perhaps those whose studies or profession
lead them to be chiefly conversant
with the offices of religion, are most apt
to fall in to this impropriety; for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
ideas being chiefly taken from that
source, their common conversation is apt
to be tinctured with fanciful allusions to
scripture expressions, to prayers, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
which have all the effect of a parody,
and, like parodies, destroy the force of
the finest passage, by associating it with
something trivial and ridiculous. Of this
nature is Swift’s well-known jest of
“Dearly beloved Roger,” which whoever
has strong upon his memory, will
find it impossible to attend with proper
seriousness to that part of the service.
We should take great care to keep clear
from all these trivial associations, in
whatever we wish to be regarded as
venerable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> species of ridicule to be
avoided, is that kind of sneer often
thrown upon those whose hearts are
giving way to honest emotion. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
is an extreme delicacy in all the finer
affections, which makes them shy of observation,
and easily checked. Love,
Wonder, Pity, the enthusiasm of Poetry,
shrink from the notice of even an indifferent
eye, and never indulge themselves
freely but in solitude, or when
heightened by the powerful force of sympathy.
Observe an ingenuous youth at
a well-wrought tragedy. If all around
him are moved, he suffers his tears to
flow freely; but if a single eye meets him
with a glance of contemptuous indifference,
he can no longer enjoy his sorrow;
he blushes at having wept, and in a moment
his heart is shut up to every impression
of tenderness. It is sometimes
mentioned as a reproach to Protestants,
that they are susceptible of a false shame
when observed in the exercises of their
religion, from which Papists are free.
But I take this to proceed from the purer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
nature of our religion; for the less it is
made to consist in outward pomp and
mechanical worship, and the more it has
to do with the finer affections of the
heart, the greater will be the reserve and
delicacy which attend the expression of
its sentiments. Indeed, ridicule ought to
be very sparingly used; for it is an
enemy to every thing sublime or tender:
the least degree of it, whether well or ill
founded, suddenly and instantaneously
stops the workings of passion, and those
who indulge a talent that way, would
do well to consider, that they are rendering
themselves for ever incapable of
all the higher pleasures either of taste or
morals. More especially do these cold
pleasantries hurt the minds of youth, by
checking that generous expansion of heart
to which their open tempers are naturally
prone, and producing a vicious shame,
through which they are deprived of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
enjoyment of heroic sentiments or generous
action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the next place, let us not be superstitiously
afraid of superstition. It shews
great ignorance of the human heart, and
the springs by which its passions are
moved, to neglect taking advantage of
the impression which particular circumstances,
times and seasons, naturally make
upon the mind. The root of all superstition
is the principle of the association
of ideas, by which, objects naturally indifferent
become dear and venerable,
through their connection with interesting
ones. It is true, this principle has been
much abused: it has given rise to pilgrimages
innumerable, worship of relics,
and priestly power. But let us not carry
our ideas of purity and simplicity so far
as to neglect it entirely. Superior natures,
it is possible, may be equally affected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>with the same truths at all times,
and in all places; but we are not so
made. Half the pleasures of elegant
minds are derived from this source.
Even the enjoyments of sense, without it,
would lose much of their attraction.
Who does not enter into the sentiment of
the Poet, in that passage so full of nature
and truth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">‘He that outlives this hour, and comes safe home,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Shall stand on tiptoe when this day is named,</div>
    <div class="p_line">And rouse him at the name of Crispian:</div>
    <div class="p_line">He that outlives this day and sees old age,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,</div>
    <div class="p_line">And say, To-morrow is St. Crispian.’</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="no_indent">But were not the benefits of the victory
equally apparent on any other day of the
year? Why commemorate the anniversary
with such distinguished regard?
Those who can ask such a question, have
never attended to some of the strongest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
instincts in our nature. Yet it has lately
been the fashion, amongst those who call
themselves rational Christians, to treat as
puerile, all attentions of this nature when
relative to religion. They would</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry poetry_2_indent">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">Kiss with pious lips the sacred earth</div>
    <div class="p_line">Which gave a Hampden or a Russel birth.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="no_indent">They will visit the banks of Avon with
all the devotion of enthusiastic zeal; celebrate
the birth-day of the hero and the
patriot; and yet pour contempt upon
the Christian who suffers himself to be
warmed by similar circumstances relating
to his Master, or the connection of sentiments
of peculiar reverence with times,
places, and men which have been appropriated
to the service of religion. A
wise preacher will not, from a fastidious
refinement, disdain to affect his hearers
from the season of the year, the anniversary
of a national blessing, a remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
escape from danger, or, in
short, any incident that is sufficiently
guarded, and far enough removed from
what is trivial, to be out of danger of
becoming ludicrous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> will not be amiss to mention here,
a reproach which has been cast upon devotional
writers, that they are apt to run
into the language of love. Perhaps the
charge would be full as just, had they
said that Love borrows the language of
Devotion; for the votaries of that passion
are fond of using those exaggerated expressions,
which can suit nothing below
Divinity; and you can hardly address the
greatest of all Beings in a strain of more
profound adoration, than the lover uses
to the object of his attachment. But the
truth is, Devotion does in no small degree
resemble that fanciful and elevated
kind of love which depends not on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
senses. Nor is the likeness to be wondered
at, since both have their source in
the love of beauty and excellence. Both
are exceeding prone to superstition, and
apt to run into romantic excesses. Both
are nourished by poetry and music, and
felt with the greatest fervour in the
warmer climates. Both carry the mind
out of itself, and powerfully refine the
affections from every thing gross, low,
and selfish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> it is time to retire; we are treading
upon enchanted ground, and shall be
suspected by many of travelling towards
the regions of chivalry and old romance.
And were it so, many a fair majestic idea
might be gathered from those forgotten
walks, which would well answer the
trouble of transplanting. It must however
be owned, that very improper language
has formerly been used on these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
subjects; but there cannot be any great
danger of such excesses, where the mind
is guarded by a rational faith, and the
social affections have full scope in the
free commerce and legitimate connections
of society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus considered the various
causes which contribute to deaden the
feelings of devotion, it may not be foreign
to the subject to enquire in what manner
they are affected by the different modes
of religion. I speak not of opinions; for
these have much less influence upon the
heart, than the circumstances which attend
particular persuasions. A sect <em>may</em>
only differ from an establishment, as one
absurd opinion differs from another: but
there is a character and cast of manners
belonging to each, which will be perfectly
distinct; and of a sect, the character
will vary as it is a rising or a declining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
sect, persecuted or at ease. Yet
while divines have wearied the world
with canvassing contrary doctrines and
jarring articles of faith, the philosopher
has not considered, as the subject deserved,
what situation was most favourable
to virtue, sentiment, and pure manners.
To a philosophic eye, free from prejudice,
and accustomed to large views of
the great polity carried on in the moral
world, perhaps varying and opposite
forms may appear proper, and well calculated
for their respective ends; and he
will neither wish entirely to destroy the
old, nor wholly to crush the new.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great line of division between different
modes of religion, is formed by
Establishments and Sects. In an infant
sect, which is always in some degree a
persecuted one, the strong union and entire
affection of its followers, the sacrifices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
they make to principle, the force of
novelty, and the amazing power of sympathy,
all contribute to cherish devotion.
It rises even to passion, and absorbs every
other sentiment. Severity of manners
imposes respect; and the earnestness of
the new proselytes renders them insensible
to injury, or even to ridicule. A strain
of eloquence, often coarse indeed, but
strong and persuasive, works like leaven
in the heart of the people. In this state,
all outward helps are superfluous, the
living spirit of devotion is amongst them,
the world sinks away to nothing before
it, and every object but one is annihilated.
The social principle mixes with
the flame, and renders it more intense;
strong parties are formed, and friends
or lovers are not more closely connected
than the members of these little communities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is this kind of devotion, a devotion
which those of more settled and peaceable
times can only guess at, which made
amends to the first Christians for all
they resigned, and all they suffered: this
draws the martyr to a willing death, and
enables the confessor to endure a voluntary
poverty. But this stage cannot last
long: the heat of persecution abates, and
the fervour of zeal feels a proportional
decay. Now comes on the period of
reasoning and examination. The principles
which have produced such mighty
effects on the minds of men, acquire an
importance, and become objects of
the public attention. Opinions are canvassed.
Those who before bore testimony
to their religion only by patient
suffering, now defend it with argument;
and all the keenness of polemical disquisition
is awakened on either side. The
fair and generous idea of religious liberty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
which never originates in the
breast of a triumphant party, now begins
to unfold itself. To vindicate these rights,
and explain these principles, learning,
which in the former state was despised,
is assiduously cultivated by the sectaries;
their minds become enlightened, and
a large portion of knowledge, especially
religious knowledge, is diffused through
their whole body. Their manners are
less austere, without having as yet lost
any thing of their original purity. Their
ministers gain respect as writers, and their
pulpit discourses are studied and judicious.
The most unfavourable circumstance
of this æra is, that those who
dissent, are very apt to acquire a critical
and disputatious spirit; for, being continually
called upon to defend doctrines in
which they differ from the generality,
their attention is early turned to the argumentative
part of religion; and hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
we see that sermons, which afford food
for this taste, are with them thought of
more importance than prayer and praise,
though these latter are undoubtedly the
more genuine and indispensible parts of
public worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> then is the second period; the
third approaches fast; men grow tired of
a controversy which becomes insipid from
being exhausted; persecution has not
only ceased, it begins to be forgotten;
and from the absence of opposition in
either kind, springs a fatal and spiritless
indifference. That sobriety, industry, and
abstinence from fashionable pleasures,
which distinguished the fathers, has made
the sons wealthy; and, eager to enjoy
their riches, they long to mix with that
world, a separation from which was the
best guard to their virtues. A secret
shame creeps in upon them, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
acknowledge their relation to a disesteemed
sect; they therefore endeavour
to file off its peculiarities, but in so
doing they destroy its very being. Connections
with the establishment, whether
of intimacy, business, or relationship,
which formerly, from their superior zeal,
turned to the advantage of the sect, now
operate against it. Yet these connections
are formed more frequently than ever;
and those who a little before, soured by
the memory of recent suffering, betrayed
perhaps an aversion from having any
thing in common with the Church, now
affect to come as near it as possible;
and, like a little boat that takes a large
vessel in tow, the sure consequence is, the
being drawn into its vortex. They aim at
elegance and show in their places of worship,
the appearance of their preachers,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and thus impoliticly awaken a taste
it is impossible they should ever gratify.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
They have worn off many forbidding singularities,
and are grown more amiable
and pleasing. But those singularities
were of use: they set a mark upon them,
they pointed them out to the world, and
thus obliged persons so distinguished to
exemplary strictness. No longer obnoxious
to the world, they are open to all
the seductions of it. Their minister, that
respectable character which once inspired
reverence and affectionate esteem, their
teacher and their guide, is now dwindled
into the mere leader of the public devotions;
or, lower yet, a person hired to
entertain them every week with an elegant
discourse. In proportion as his importance
decreases, his salary sits heavy
on the people; and he feels himself depressed
by that most cruel of all mortifications
to a generous mind, the consciousness
of being a burden upon those
from whom he derives his scanty support.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Unhappily, amidst this change of manners,
there are forms of strictness, and a
set of phrases introduced in their first enthusiasm,
which still subsist: these they
are ashamed to use, and know not how to
decline; and their behaviour, in consequence
of them, is awkward and irresolute.
Those who have set out with the
largest share of mysticism and flighty
zeal, find themselves particularly embarrassed
by this circumstance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> things are come to this crisis,
their tendency is evident: and though
the interest and name of a sect may be
kept up for a time by the generosity
of former ages, the abilities of particular
men, or that reluctance which keeps a
generous mind from breaking old connections;
it must, in a short course of
years, melt away into the establishment,
the womb and the grave of all other
modes of religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> <em>Establishment</em> affects the mind by
splendid buildings, music, the mysterious
pomp of antient ceremonies; by the sacredness
of peculiar orders, habits, and
titles; by its secular importance; and by
connecting with religion, ideas of order,
dignity, and antiquity. It speaks to the
heart through the imagination and the
senses; and though it never can raise devotion
so high as we have described it in
a beginning sect, it will preserve it from
ever sinking into contempt. As, to a woman
in the glow of health and beauty,
the most careless dress is the most becoming;
but when the freshness of youth
is worn off, greater attention is necessary,
and rich ornaments are required to throw
an air of dignity round her person: so
while a sect retains its first plainness, simplicity
and affectionate zeal, it wants nothing
an establishment could give; but
that once declined, the latter becomes far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
more respectable. The faults of an establishment
grow venerable from length of
time; the improvements of a sect appear
whimsical from their novelty. Antient
families, fond of rank, and of that
order which secures it to them, are on
the side of the former. Traders incline
to the latter; and so do generally men
of genius, as it favours their originality
of thinking. An establishment leans to
superstition, a sect to enthusiasm; the one
is a more dangerous and violent excess,
the other more fatally debilitates the
powers of the mind; the one is a deeper
colouring, the other a more lasting dye;
but the coldness and languor of a declining
sect produces scepticism. Indeed,
a sect is never stationary, as it depends
entirely on passions and opinions; though
it often attains excellence, it never rests
in it, but is always in danger of one
extreme or the other; whereas an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
establishment, whatever else it may want,
possesses the grandeur arising from
stability.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> learn to respect whatever respects
itself; and are easily led to think that
system requires no alteration, which never
admits of any. It is this circumstance,
more than any other, which gives a dignity
to that accumulated mass of error,
the Church of Rome. A fabric which
has weathered many successive ages,
though the architecture be rude, the
parts disproportionate, and overloaded
with ornament, strikes us with a sort of
admiration, merely from its having held
so long together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <em>minister</em> of a sect, and of an establishment,
is upon a very different footing.
The former is like the popular
leader of an army; he is obeyed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
enthusiasm while he is obeyed at all;
but his influence depends on opinion,
and is entirely personal: the latter resembles
a general appointed by the
monarch; he has soldiers less warmly
devoted to him, but more steady, and
better disciplined. The dissenting teacher
is nothing if he have not the spirit of a
martyr; and is the scorn of the world, if
he be not above the world. The clergyman,
possessed of power and affluence,
and for that reason chosen from among
the better ranks of people, is respected as
a gentleman, though not venerated as an
apostle; and as his profession generally
obliges him to decent manners, his order
is considered as a more regular and
civilized class of men than their fellow-subjects
of the same rank. The dissenting
teacher, separated from the people, but
not raised above them, invested with no
power, entitled to no emoluments, if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
cannot acquire for himself authority, must
feel the bitterness of dependance. The
ministers of the former denomination cannot
fall, but in some violent convulsion
of the state: those of the latter, when indifference
and mutual neglect begin to
succeed to that close union which once
subsisted between them and their followers,
lose their former influence without
resource; the dignity and weight of
their office is gone for ever; they feel
the insignificancy of their pretensions,
their spirits sink, and, except they take
refuge in some collateral pursuit, and
stand candidates for literary fame, they
slide into an ambiguous and undecided
character; their time is too often sacrificed
to frivolous compliances; their
manners lose their austerity, without
having proportionally gained in elegance;
the world does not acknowledge
them, for they are not of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
world; it cannot esteem them, for they
are not superior to the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> the whole, then, it should seem,
that the strictness of a sect (and it can
only be respectable by being strict) is
calculated for a few finer spirits, who
make Religion their chief object. As
to the much larger number, on whom
she has only an imperfect influence,
making them decent if not virtuous,
and meliorating the heart without greatly
changing it; for all these the genius of
an establishment is more eligible, and
better fitted to cherish that moderate devotion
of which alone they are capable.
All those who have not strength of mind
to think for themselves, who would live
to virtue without denying the world, who
wish much to be religious, but more
to be genteel&mdash;naturally flow into the
establishment. If it offered no motives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
to their minds, but such as are perfectly
pure and spiritual, their devotion would
not for that be more exalted, it would die
away to nothing; and it is better their
minds should receive only a tincture of
religion, than be wholly without it.
Those too, whose passions are regular and
equable, and who do not aim at abstracted
virtues, are commonly placed to
most advantage within the pale of the
national faith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the greater exertions of the mind,
spirit to reform, fortitude and constancy
to suffer, can be expected only from
those who, forsaking the common road,
are exercised in a peculiar course of
moral discipline: but it should be remembered,
that these exertions cannot
be expected from every character, nor on
every occasion. Indeed, religion is a
sentiment which takes such strong hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
on all the most powerful principles of
our nature, that it may easily be carried
to excess. The Deity never meant our
regards to him should engross the mind:
that indifference to sensible objects, which
many moralists preach, is not perhaps desirable,
except where the mind is raised
above its natural tone, and extraordinary
situations call forth extraordinary
virtues.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the peculiar advantages of a sect
were well understood, its followers would
not be impatient of those moderate restraints
which do not rise to persecution,
nor affect any of their more material interests:
for, do they not bind them closer
to each other, cherish zeal, and keep up
the love of liberty? What is the language
of such restraints? Do they not
say, with a prevailing voice, Let the timorous
and the worldly depart; no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
shall be of this persuasion, who is not sincere,
disinterested, conscientious. It is
notwithstanding proper, that men should
be sensible of all their rights, assert them
boldly, and protest against every infringement;
for it may be of advantage
to bear what yet it is unjustifiable in
others to inflict.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neither</span> would dissenters, if they attended
to their real interests, be so ambitious
as they generally are, of rich converts.
Such converts only accelerate
their decline; they relax their discipline,
and they acquire an influence very pernicious
in societies which ought to breathe
nothing but the spirit of equality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sects</span> are always strict in proportion
to the corruption of establishments and
the licentiousness of the times, and they
are useful in the same proportion. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
the austere lives of the primitive Christians
counterbalanced the vices of that
abandoned period; and thus the Puritans
in the reign of Charles the Second seasoned
with a wholesome severity the profligacy
of public manners. They were
less amiable than their descendants of the
present day; but to be amiable was not
the object: they were of public utility;
and their scrupulous sanctity (carried to
excess, themselves only considered) like a
powerful antiseptic, opposed the contagion
breathed from a most dissolute court.
In like manner, that sect, one of whose
most striking characteristics is a beautiful
simplicity of dialect, served to check that
strain of servile flattery and Gothic compliment
so prevalent in the same period,
and to keep up some idea of that manly
plainness with which one human being
ought to address another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> have we seen that different
modes of religion, though they bear little
good-will to each other, are nevertheless
mutually useful. Perhaps there is not an
establishment so corrupt, as not to make
the gross of mankind better than they
would be without it. Perhaps there is
not a sect so eccentric, but that it has set
some one truth in the strongest light, or
carried some one virtue, before neglected,
to its utmost height, or loosened some
obstinate and long-rooted prejudice.
They answer their end; they die away;
others spring up, and take their place.
So the purer part of the element, continually
drawn off from the mighty mass
of waters, forms rivers, which, running
in various directions, fertilize large countries;
yet, always tending towards the
ocean, every accession to their bulk or
grandeur but precipitates their course,
and hastens their re-union with the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
reservoir from which they were
separated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the mean time, the devout heart
always finds associates suitable to its disposition,
and the particular cast of its
virtues; while the continual flux and
reflux of opinions prevents the active
principles from stagnating. There is an
analogy between things material and immaterial.
As, from some late experiments
in philosophy it has been found,
that the process of vegetation restores
and purifies vitiated air; so does that
moral and political ferment which accompanies
the growth of new sects, communicate
a kind of spirit and elasticity
necessary to the vigour and health of
the soul, but soon lost amidst the corrupted
breath of an indiscriminate multitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> remains only to add, lest the
preceding view of Sects and Establishments
should in any degree be misapprehended,
that it has nothing to do
with the <em>truth</em> of opinions, and relates
only to the influence which the adventitious
circumstances attending them may
have upon the manners and morals of
their followers. It is therefore calculated
to teach us candour, but not indifference.
Large views of the moral polity of the
world may serve to illustrate the providence
of God in his different dispensations,
but are not made to regulate our
own individual conduct, which must conscientiously
follow our own opinions and
belief. We may see much good in an
Establishment, the doctrines of which we
cannot give our assent to without violating
our integrity; we may respect the
tendencies of a Sect, the tenets of which
we utterly disapprove. We may think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
practices useful which we cannot adopt
without hypocrisy. We may think all
religions beneficial, and believe of one
alone that it is true.</p>
